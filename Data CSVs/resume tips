"I often get referrals from colleagues in my network asking me to chat with someone who's going through a job transition. When I meet with them, I share this advice:\n\nGet out of your own head. Whatever the reason for your transition, be confident in who you are. Don't start second-guessing yourself or the reasons for the change. Learn from the past when needed and move forward. Now is not the time for imposter syndrome.\n\nStart by making a list of work that genuinely inspires you. About 70% of high-performing professionals find success by aligning their passion with their profession. What truly brings you joy at work?\n\nNext, make a list of organizations you admire within the geography you want to work. Research these organizations looking for clues that relate to your list. This should include checking their websites, Glassdoor, and asking friends and colleagues. You may discover companies you didn't even know existed.\n\nStart networking. The days of just applying for a job and hoping your resume gets picked are over. Begin by checking your admired organization's LinkedIn page for connections you know, or people who can introduce you to key contacts. Look at open roles that might interest you, but remember, new roles are created all the time when the right person shows up. Doing this can get your resume in front of the actual hiring manager.\n\nLastly, tell everyone you meet that you're looking for work – even your dog groomer might know of an awesome role through one of their customers (to be clear, you want input from the dog parents, not the dog 😊).\n\nAll this will transform your job search from transactional to transformational. Position yourself as a strategic solution, not just a candidate. Organizations invest in professionals who solve complex challenges.\n\nRemember: Companies hire potential, not just past achievements. Highlight your unique value and show how your skills can drive organizational success.\n\n🏅 What tips do you have that have worked for you in your search?\n\n\n…more"

"The secret to landing that dream job? It's so simple.\n\nNEVER USE PDFs FOR YOUR RESUME. Too easy for your prospective hiring manager to open. Make them work for it. Use a weird format like .BMP or .Tiff. This provides an air of mystery to your resume. ""What could this be? How the hell do I even open a TARGA file in 2025?"" Hiring managers love puzzle solving, so give them something they can really sink their teeth into.\n\nSTART INTERVIEWS BY REVEALING A TRAGIC FAMILY SECRET: You can make one up if you need to. ""My grandpa could have stopped Ted Bundy, but didn't"" is a good one. ""Every one of my uncles is a horse thief"" is more niche, but there's a timeless quality to it. My tip? Have fun with it.\n\nINSIST ON BEING PAID IN RARE JEWELS: Inflation, shmilflation! Sure, it may take a few extra steps, but nothing spends better than a sack full of sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds. Slapping down a topaz at the local five and dime is a real flex.\n\nFORCE YOUR INTERVIEWER TO TAKE A POSITION ON MARTIN LUTHER: Divinely inspired reformer, or blasphemous oaf? Both positions are respectable, but make them take a side, and more importantly, defend it.\n\nEND WITH A SONG: Most interviewers end interviews with ""Do you have any more questions?"" This is when you queue up some music and say, ""Just one: do you enjoy Billy Joel's middle period?"" That's when you can delight them with a rendition of ""Uptown Girl"" or ""Allentown."" Don't go for B-Sides like ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"" or ""Running on Ice"" you'll just be wasting everyone's time.\n\nHope this helps!

"The painful truth about ATS ""hacks"" that no one's talking about...\n\nI see job seekers spending countless hours:\n✔️ Cramming keywords\n✔️ Using white text\n✔️ Creating complex tables\n✔️ Testing ""perfect"" formatting tricks\n\nHere's the reality: Modern ATS systems are FAR more sophisticated than you think. Those outdated hacks from 2015? They might actually be hurting your chances.\n\nInstead, focus on what truly matters:\n\nWrite for humans first, ATS second The hiring manager needs to WANT to read your resume. Clear, compelling achievements beat keyword stuffing every time.\n\nUse clean, standard formatting Simple beats clever. Period.

"Reassessing Resume Gaps: A Shift in Perspective\n\nTo Employers:\nWhen evaluating candidates, it's crucial to look beyond resume gaps and recognize the inherent value they may bring. Inspired by HBR, consider these tips for assessing career breaks:\n- Inquire about the story behind the gap to uncover valuable skills, resilience, or renewed direction.\n- Emphasize growth over gaps, acknowledging how candidates use this time to upskill, volunteer, or reflect on their career trajectory.\n- Acknowledge the evolving norm of career breaks post-pandemic, understanding its impact on workers' priorities.\n- Value authenticity in candidates who address gaps with honesty and confidence, traits they may bring to your team.\n\nRemember, a resume gap signifies more than a pause—it often symbolizes a period of growth, learning, or life management. Keeping an open mind could lead you to your next exceptional hire.\n\nTo Job Seekers:\n- Address resume gaps directly, focusing on the positive aspects and how they enriched your life or skills.\n- Highlight personal growth during the gap, showcasing volunteer work, new skills acquired, or realigned goals.\n- Tailor your explanation to the role, emphasizing how your experiences strengthen your candidacy.\n- Confidently own your unique career journey, understanding that a gap doesn't define you; it's how you navigate and learn from it that matters.\n\nHave you considered the untapped potential of resume gaps?

"🌟 Boost Your Job Search with the Power of High-Quality Recommendations 🌟\n\nIn a competitive job market, one of the most effective ways to get your resume noticed is through your network and their recommendations. A well-timed and thoughtful recommendation can make all the difference.\n\nHere’s how you can leverage this to your advantage:\n\n1.

Here's what might be holding yours back:\n\n🔑 Lack of Relevant Experience\nIf your experience doesn't align with the job, recruiters may move on. Tailor your resume to highlight the most relevant skills and achievements.\n\n📝 Poor Resume Formatting\nA cluttered or difficult-to-read resume can be a dealbreaker. Stick to a clean format with clear headings and bullet points.\n\n📚 Missing Keywords\nApplicant Tracking Systems (ATS) scan for specific keywords. If they’re missing, your resume may be filtered out before anyone sees it.\n\n⏳ Employment Gaps Without Explanation\nGaps happen, and that’s okay—but explain them. Highlight growth during these periods, whether through learning, caregiving, or volunteering.\n\n🎯 Generic Objective Statements\nOutdated or vague objectives don’t help. Use a strong professional summary to show your value upfront.\n\n🔍 Typos and Grammar Errors\nMistakes show a lack of attention to detail. Double-check or ask someone to review it for you.\n\n⚠️ Inconsistent or Inaccurate Information\nInconsistent job titles or inflated claims raise red flags. Honesty is key.\n\n📊 Lack of Measurable Achievements\nJust listing job duties isn’t enough. Show your impact using numbers, percentages, and results.\n\n💡 By addressing these points, you’ll significantly increase your chances of getting noticed. Want more resume tips or career advice?

Here are some essential tips to make your resume stand out:\n\n1. Clear Contact Information\nMake sure your name, phone number, email address, and LinkedIn profile are easy to find. If you have a personal website or portfolio, include that too!\n\n2. Compelling Professional Summary\nKick things off with a brief but powerful summary of your experience, strengths, and career goals. This sets the tone for the rest of your resume.\n\n3. Tailored Skills Section\nList relevant skills for the job you're applying for. Focus on a balance of both hard and soft skills that match the role.\n\n4. Achievements Over Responsibilities\nInstead of just listing job duties, highlight your key achievements. Quantify your successes with numbers (e.g., increased sales by 30%, led a team of 5).\n\n5. Experience That Shows Impact\nDescribe your roles using action verbs and focus on the impact you made. This will demonstrate your contribution and value to potential employers.\n\n6. Keep It Concise\nA resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages. Be concise and cut out unnecessary information. Employers often skim resumes, so make it easy for them to spot key details.\n\n7. Education & Certifications\nList your degrees, certifications, and any additional training relevant to the job. Be sure to include dates and institutions.\n\n8.

"Most résumés are boring and forgettable.\n\nHere’s how to make yours stand out. \n\nMost people treat their résumé like a history book, listing every job they’ve had and every task they’ve done. \n\nBut hiring managers don’t need a timeline, they need a reason to say YES.\n\nHere’s how to make your résumé stand out in a way most people overlook:\n\n🔹 Write for the Future, Not the Past\nYour résumé should position you for the job you WANT, not just reflect what you’ve done. Tailor your skills and accomplishments to align with the next step in your career.\n\n🔹 Your Job Title Isn’t Enough, Show the Impact\nInstead of “Managed training programs,” say “Designed and implemented training programs that increased employee productivity by 30%.” Numbers tell a story.\n\n🔹 Your Summary Shouldn’t Be Boring\nAvoid clichés like “hardworking professional seeking opportunities.” Instead, answer: What makes you different? Why should they hire YOU?\n\n🔹 Remove Fluff That Wastes Space\nPhrases like “responsible for” or “assisted with” weaken your impact. Get straight to the result. What did you do? What happened because of it?\n\n🔹 Make It Easy to Skim\nHiring managers scan résumés in seconds. Use bold headings, bullet points, and clear formatting so they can see your value fast.\n\nYour résumé isn’t just a document, it’s your first impression.\n\nMake them want to know more.\n\nDoes your résumé sell your value or just list your past?\n\n…more"

"👀 Is Your Resume Easy to Read?\n\nAfter you’ve created your resume, take a moment to visually inspect it. Why? Because if it’s hard to read or navigate, it might not get the attention it deserves. Here’s a quick checklist to ensure it stands out:\n🔍 Top-to-Bottom Flow\nDoes your resume naturally guide the reader’s eye from the top of the page to the bottom and eventually landing on the experience section? That’s the most critical part—if it’s hard to find, you’re doing yourself a disservice.\n\n📂 Key Details at a Glance\nCan someone quickly spot your job titles, company names, and employment dates? Recruiters and hiring managers prioritize this information when evaluating your experience. Use different font sizes, bold and spacing to differential the info on your resume.\n\n🎯 Communicating Accomplishments\nDoes your resume highlight impact and relevance, or is it just a list of responsibilities? Think about the moments you’d proudly share during a performance review or promotion discussion. Those should be your first and second bullet points under every role.\n\n💡 Pro Tip\nIf your company is not well known, use one sentance to describe what the company does/industry it's in. It's one of the most common questions hiring managers have when reviewing a resume. ""What's that company do?""\n\n…more"
"Recently, I reviewed a resume so GOOD, it made me pause in the middle of my lunch & call the candidate to schedule an interview.\n\nIt wasn't just the layout or the fancy font that caught my eye; it was the clear, concise way the candidate's achievements and experiences were presented.\n\nIt was evident they had done their homework, tailoring their resume specifically for the role, making it impossible to ignore.\n\nSo, what's the recipe for a standout resume? 📄✨\n\n1. 𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐬 𝐊𝐞𝐲: Don't send out a one-size-fits-all resume. Tailor it to the job you're applying for, highlighting the experience and skills that align with the job description.\n\n\n2.

"As a recruiter, I view resumes fairly often 😋\n\nHehe, if I can, just a few tips and ideas for those on the employment search?\n(I am by no means a PRO, this purely my opinion from patterns I and my team see.)\n\nAnd by all means, ignore everything I say... we enjoy a good laugh 😁😁\n\n\nHonestly, I would like to spend more time talking with YOU rather than asking about all the gaps or confusion that comes from unfinished or empty resumes.\n(I hope this finds the right audience 😬!)\n\nSo...\n\n1. INTRO - We love an intro! Every Indeed manufactured resume looks generic with the ""will relocate anywhere"" which, frankly, isn't true.\nTell me about you and what your goal is in seeking a new position! This helps me get a head start when I get a blurb about what you want and where you are at in your search.\n\n2. DATES - For the love of all things holy and good and...\nClean up your dates, don't leave gaps, and explain temp, contract, or seasonal jobs. We automatically rule out poor job longevity so if you explain the reason behind short-term positions, boom!\n\n3. CONTEXT - Give me context please! Who are you?!\nWhether you work at a Warehouse, in Construction, or got involved in Manufacturing... it seems that unless you are OCD, most of the time there is a LACK of information on what you actually did on your resume. Keep in mind- sometimes title doesn't match responsibilities. Add leadership skills and certificates to your timeline so we can really see what you have to offer!\n\n4. ERRORS- *clears throat. We pay attention to spelling and grammar errors. I mean, we're here to help update all that for your future employer, but if you catch it, make the change! This includes resume gaps that we want to understand AND inconsistency in punctuation, font, and bullet points.\nTake a second to review before uploading.\n\n5. SKILLS - Don't let a resume generator do all the work! I want to know what YOU specifically can do and that is not always given proper honor when you allow a hiring site to guess your skills based on your previous roles. Really think about what you have accrued besides the typical additions of ""time management"" and ""customer service."" We know you have more to offer!\n\nJust a few thoughts! We would love to give you and your future employer the BEST CHANCE in connecting.\n…more"
"The design, layout, and content of your resume are essential for capturing the reader's attention in the first 20 to 30 seconds. It’s important to approach this task with a clear strategy, focusing on highlighting your skills and experience in a concise and engaging way. Here are a few tips to help you craft the perfect resume:\n\n1. Highlight your accomplishments: If you cut costs, increased revenue, delivered projects ahead of time, or broke company records, your resume is the perfect place to highlight these achievements using numbers and percentages to demonstrate your impact.\n2. Call out the value you would bring to the target company: Just like in sports, where the value of a new player is debated, your resume is the place to highlight the value you can bring to a potential employer, using the language that aligns with the job you're applying for.\n3. Identify the ways you help solve the company’s challenges: Just like an infomercial highlights a product’s strengths to solve a problem, your resume should showcase your professional assets and demonstrate how you can address the challenges of the company you're applying to.\n\nThe right job for you is out there.

Remove Outdated Skills: If it's no longer relevant (e.g., obsolete software), leave it out.\n4. Use a Hybrid Resume Format: A skills-focused format helps showcase expertise before listing work history.\n5. Tailor for Each Job: Only include roles that are directly relevant.\nRemember, your resume should be a highlight reel, not a documentary.

"The secret to landing that dream job? It's so simple.\n\nNEVER USE PDFs FOR YOUR RESUME. Too easy for your prospective hiring manager to open. Make them work for it. Use a weird format like .BMP or .Tiff. This provides an air of mystery to your resume. ""What could this be? How the hell do I even open a TARGA file in 2025?"" Hiring managers love puzzle solving, so give them something they can really sink their teeth into.\n\nSTART INTERVIEWS BY REVEALING A TRAGIC FAMILY SECRET: You can make one up if you need to. ""My grandpa could have stopped Ted Bundy, but didn't"" is a good one. ""Every one of my uncles is a horse thief"" is more niche, but there's a timeless quality to it. My tip? Have fun with it.\n\nINSIST ON BEING PAID IN RARE JEWELS: Inflation, shmilflation! Sure, it may take a few extra steps, but nothing spends better than a sack full of sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds. Slapping down a topaz at the local five and dime is a real flex.\n\nFORCE YOUR INTERVIEWER TO TAKE A POSITION ON MARTIN LUTHER: Divinely inspired reformer, or blasphemous oaf? Both positions are respectable, but make them take a side, and more importantly, defend it.\n\nEND WITH A SONG: Most interviewers end interviews with ""Do you have any more questions?"" This is when you queue up some music and say, ""Just one: do you enjoy Billy Joel's middle period?"" That's when you can delight them with a rendition of ""Uptown Girl"" or ""Allentown."" Don't go for B-Sides like ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"" or ""Running on Ice"" you'll just be wasting everyone's time.\n\nHope this helps!

What matters is how relevant and concise your content is.\n\n2. Gaps in Your Resume Are Dealbreakers\nLife happens! As long as you address gaps confidently and show how you stayed active or grew during them, it won’t sink your chances.\n\n3. You Always Need References\nNope! Employers typically ask for references after you’ve made it through the initial stages. Keep them on hand but off your resume.\n\n4. Your Resume Should Be ""Unique""\nA flashy, one-of-a-kind resume isn’t necessary unless you’re in a creative field. Focus on clarity and relevance instead of gimmicks.\n\n5. You Have to List Your Full Address\nThe days of snail mail are over! Just list your city and state—no need for your full address.\n\n6. Dates and Employer Names Aren’t Important\nThink again!

"Another lesson learned from responses I've received to ""no thank you"" emails sent to applicants: I occasionally get responses from applicants pointing out how relevant their experience is--experience not apparent in their resume. Candidates, make it easy on both sides:\n\n* Customize your resume for every job you apply for.\n* Look at the skills, responsibilities, and experience in the job posting and then make sure as many of those as possible are explicitly stated in your resume (within the bounds of truth, of course).\n* Use easy-to-skim bullets. Don't make a recruiter squint through long paragraphs trying to understand your value.\n* Don't assume that a recruiter understands what your previous roles have involved. If you're applying for a job that requires phone skills, for example, spell out in your resume how you've used phone skills in previous roles.\n\nDoing the above helps a recruiter quickly see your relevance to their job and boosts your chances of getting an interview. A win for all!\n\n\n…more"

Tailor your skills and accomplishments to align with the next step in your career.\n\n🔹 Your Job Title Isn’t Enough, Show the Impact\nInstead of “Managed training programs,” say “Designed and implemented training programs that increased employee productivity by 30%.” Numbers tell a story.\n\n🔹 Your Summary Shouldn’t Be Boring\nAvoid clichés like “hardworking professional seeking opportunities.” Instead, answer: What makes you different? Why should they hire YOU?\n\n🔹 Remove Fluff That Wastes Space\nPhrases like “responsible for” or “assisted with” weaken your impact. Get straight to the result. What did you do? What happened because of it?\n\n🔹 Make It Easy to Skim\nHiring managers scan résumés in seconds.

Inspired by HBR, consider these tips for assessing career breaks:\n- Inquire about the story behind the gap to uncover valuable skills, resilience, or renewed direction.\n- Emphasize growth over gaps, acknowledging how candidates use this time to upskill, volunteer, or reflect on their career trajectory.\n- Acknowledge the evolving norm of career breaks post-pandemic, understanding its impact on workers' priorities.\n- Value authenticity in candidates who address gaps with honesty and confidence, traits they may bring to your team.\n\nRemember, a resume gap signifies more than a pause—it often symbolizes a period of growth, learning, or life management. Keeping an open mind could lead you to your next exceptional hire.\n\nTo Job Seekers:\n- Address resume gaps directly, focusing on the positive aspects and how they enriched your life or skills.\n- Highlight personal growth during the gap, showcasing volunteer work, new skills acquired, or realigned goals.\n- Tailor your explanation to the role, emphasizing how your experiences strengthen your candidacy.\n- Confidently own your unique career journey, understanding that a gap doesn't define you; it's how you navigate and learn from it that matters.\n\nHave you considered the untapped potential of resume gaps? Individuals with extended breaks have secured remarkable roles by leveraging their distinctive strengths and experiences.

"I often get referrals from colleagues in my network asking me to chat with someone who's going through a job transition. When I meet with them, I share this advice:\n\nGet out of your own head. Whatever the reason for your transition, be confident in who you are. Don't start second-guessing yourself or the reasons for the change. Learn from the past when needed and move forward. Now is not the time for imposter syndrome.\n\nStart by making a list of work that genuinely inspires you. About 70% of high-performing professionals find success by aligning their passion with their profession. What truly brings you joy at work?\n\nNext, make a list of organizations you admire within the geography you want to work. Research these organizations looking for clues that relate to your list. This should include checking their websites, Glassdoor, and asking friends and colleagues. You may discover companies you didn't even know existed.\n\nStart networking. The days of just applying for a job and hoping your resume gets picked are over. Begin by checking your admired organization's LinkedIn page for connections you know, or people who can introduce you to key contacts. Look at open roles that might interest you, but remember, new roles are created all the time when the right person shows up. Doing this can get your resume in front of the actual hiring manager.\n\nLastly, tell everyone you meet that you're looking for work – even your dog groomer might know of an awesome role through one of their customers (to be clear, you want input from the dog parents, not the dog 😊).\n\nAll this will transform your job search from transactional to transformational. Position yourself as a strategic solution, not just a candidate. Organizations invest in professionals who solve complex challenges.\n\nRemember: Companies hire potential, not just past achievements. Highlight your unique value and show how your skills can drive organizational success.\n\n🏅 What tips do you have that have worked for you in your search?\n\n\n…more"

Keep it clean and pro. Make the format easy on the eyes, not an eye-catcher.\n\n🚫 Myth 3: Your Resume Should Have a Photo of You\n\nFalse alarm! Unless they ask, skip the photo. It's a distraction, not a necessity. Save that space for something valuable.\n\n🚫 Myth 4: Only Paid Experience Counts\n\nNot true! If you're a fresher with internships and projects, they matter. No need for paid gigs right away. Your skills and efforts count too.\n\n🚫 Myth 5: You Need to Add an Objective Section\n\nNah, they're kinda useless. Everyone wants to apply their skills. Instead, use that space wisely. Highlight your key skills and results – make it count.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nRemember, stay informed and keep your knowledge fresh.\n\nComment if you know more resume myths! 💬\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…more"

"👀 Is Your Resume Easy to Read?\n\nAfter you’ve created your resume, take a moment to visually inspect it. Why? Because if it’s hard to read or navigate, it might not get the attention it deserves. Here’s a quick checklist to ensure it stands out:\n🔍 Top-to-Bottom Flow\nDoes your resume naturally guide the reader’s eye from the top of the page to the bottom and eventually landing on the experience section? That’s the most critical part—if it’s hard to find, you’re doing yourself a disservice.\n\n📂 Key Details at a Glance\nCan someone quickly spot your job titles, company names, and employment dates? Recruiters and hiring managers prioritize this information when evaluating your experience. Use different font sizes, bold and spacing to differential the info on your resume.\n\n🎯 Communicating Accomplishments\nDoes your resume highlight impact and relevance, or is it just a list of responsibilities? Think about the moments you’d proudly share during a performance review or promotion discussion. Those should be your first and second bullet points under every role.\n\n💡 Pro Tip\nIf your company is not well known, use one sentance to describe what the company does/industry it's in. It's one of the most common questions hiring managers have when reviewing a resume. ""What's that company do?""\n\n…more"

"Tip of the Week: Your Resume Should Be a Movie Trailer, Not the Whole Script\n\nIf your resume reads like a generic job description, we have a problem. Hiring managers don’t want to see a list of what you were supposed to do—they want to see what you actually did.\n\nSaying “Managed cloud infrastructure” is the resume equivalent of saying you “existed” at work. Instead, try “Optimized cloud resources to cut hosting costs by 35% while improving system uptime to 99.98%.”\n\nSee the difference? Numbers, results, and real impact make you stand out.\n\nThink of your resume like a movie trailer—it should hook the audience, highlight the best moments, and leave them wanting more. What projects did you crush? What problems did you solve? How did your work make life easier, faster, or more efficient for your team? If your resume doesn’t make hiring managers excited to learn more, it’s time for a rewrite.\n\nHiring managers want problem-solvers, not a recap of job duties. Show them the action, the impact, and the results.\n\nWhat’s the best resume tip that helped you land an interview? Drop it in the comments!\n…more"

Here are some key reasons why resumes get rejected at first glance:\n\n1. Grammatical & Spelling Errors – A resume full of typos reflects a lack of attention to detail. Proofread carefully or use tools like Grammarly.\n\n2. Listing Every Possible Tool & Technology – Don’t just add all buzzwords to get a call. Only mention technologies you have actual hands-on experience with.\n\n3. Over-Reliance on AI-Generated Resumes – Using AI (like ChatGPT) to refine your resume is fine, but copying generic content can make it sound impersonal and irrelevant to your real experience.\n\n4. Frequent Job Hopping Without Explanation – If your resume shows job changes every few months or years, it raises red flags for recruiters. Address it in your profile summary if needed.\n\n5. Vague One-Word Responsibilities – Writing generic words like “Implementation,” “Development,” or “Support” for every project doesn’t help. Be specific about your contributions.\n\n6. Missing Project Durations & Education Year – Always mention the timeline for each project and your education year to avoid confusion about experience level.\n\nWant to stand out?

"✨ When your resume feels more like a novel than a professional summary... 📚✂️\n\nLet’s face it: we’ve all been there. You’ve had that moment where you’re staring at a resume and wondering, ""Did I just write a biography of my entire career?"" 🤔\n\nThe truth is, resumes shouldn’t be a War and Peace level saga. They should be short, sweet, and packed with punch. 🥊 (and NO, punch doesn’t mean fluffy jargon!)\n\nI help my clients cut through the clutter and showcase their skills in a way that grabs attention without writing a whole memoir. Because let’s be real — hiring managers don’t have time for that... they’ve got hundreds of resumes to scan! 🕵️‍♂️\n\n🔑 Key Takeaways:\n\n_Tailor your experience for the role you want (you’re not applying for every job on the market!).\n_Quantify results (yes, numbers are your best friend).\n_Make it scannable. Remember, the hiring manager is probably looking at your resume in less than 10 seconds.\n\nIf you’re ready to turn your resume from ""novel-length"" to ""killer marketing piece"" — let’s chat!\n\n…more"
"With over 250 applications per job opening on average, that resume needs a strategic approach to consistently grab the attention needed to get you in the door.\n\nSo, is yours designed for easy consumption and comprehension? If you are only paying attention to what goes in it and not how it is delivered, you might have a problem.\n\nHiring managers and recruiters spend hours reviewing resumes, their eyes weary and strained. Respect their time by ensuring your resume is easy to read and navigate.\n\nHere are some best practices for making your resume as readable as possible:\n\n📜 Use a Clean Design: Stick to professional fonts (like Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman) and avoid unnecessary graphics or images. Keep font sizes between 10 and 12 points for readability.\n\n📜 Structure for Navigation: Use clear headings, bold job titles, and bullet points to guide the reader through your experience. Think of your resume as if it were a map. Navigation cues will help your reader find the information they need quickly.\n\n📜 Emphasize White Space: White space isn’t wasted space, it is in fact essential for readability. Like a well-designed advertisement, a resume with balanced white space draws attention to key points and prevents the page from feeling overwhelming. Research done in the graphic design field emphasizes that white space enhances readability and legibility, allowing key information to stand out and reducing cognitive load for the reader.\n\n📜 Tailor and Highlight: Place the most relevant achievements and skills at the top of each section. You only have seconds to make an impression, so make those seconds count.\n\nMake no mistake, folks. That resume is supposed to be a marketing tool and not just some laundry list of duties. The design and layout needs to reflect that. Just as advertisers use clean layouts to convey a message quickly, your resume’s design should allow hiring managers to see your value at a glance.\n\nWhat’s one thing you could do today to make your resume more readable?\n\n…more"

Here are the top 8 things recruiters typically scan for (forget page count!):\n\nLocation: Make it easy for them to see if you're a local candidate.\n\n\nSummary/Profile: Briefly showcase your key experiences and what makes you stand out.\n\n\nCompany Name (1-3 sentence summary): Quickly explain what the company did (e.g., ""Developed educational software for children"" or ""Managed social media campaigns for a non-profit"").\n\n\nTitle: Highlight the specific role you held (use the same wording as the job description if possible).\n\n\nDates: Be transparent about your employment history, including month and year (short stints are okay!).\n\n\nMetrics: Quantify your achievements whenever possible (e.g., ""Increased website traffic by 20%""). Numbers grab attention!\n\n\nEducation: Include it if it's relevant to the job (essential for some roles like doctors or engineers).\n\n\nTechnical Skills (if applicable): List relevant skills, but showcase them further in your bullet points with specific examples.\n\n\nWhat else are recruiters looking for?\n\nWhile ""soft skills"" aren't the answer this time, here are some recruiter favorites:\nClear and concise writing (avoid typos!) ️\n\nStrong action verbs that showcase your achievements (e.g., ""spearheaded,"" ""managed,"" ""increased"")\n\nTailored content that speaks directly to the job description\n\n\nP.S. Big Company Work Experience? Be Specific!\n\nIf you worked for a giant like Google, mention the specific division or function (e.g., ""Google Search Ads team"" or ""Google Cloud Platform engineering""). This clarifies your unique experience within the vast company.\n\n\nBy focusing on these key elements, you can craft a resume that gets noticed and lands you that interview!\n…more"

It's time to change your approach.\n\n-For starters, don’t just send resumes. Build connections!\n\nReach out to people at the companies you're interested in and have conversations—people hire people, not resumes or job boards.\n\n-Next, tailor your resume for each application.\n\nUse tools to identify relevant keywords and align your experience with the role. It’s a small effort that can make a huge difference.\n\n-Showcasing your work is another powerful strategy.\n\nShare your achievements on platforms like LinkedIn or create a portfolio to highlight your skills and projects. A simple resume doesn’t fully show your capabilities. Take it a step further to stand out and leave a lasting impression.\n\n-Networking is crucial—but don’t wait until you need help.\n\nBuild genuine relationships consistently so that when the time comes, you have a strong network to lean on.\n\n-And don’t be afraid to take risks.\n\nExperiment with new skills, tackle unfamiliar problems, and step out of your comfort zone. Growth happens when you challenge yourself.\n\n-Lastly, lift others as you climb.\n\nYou don’t need a title to make an impact. Mentor, support, and share knowledge with others. Helping people along the way often leads to unexpected opportunities.\n\nTo achieve different results, you need to take a different path. Start implementing these strategies today and see the difference they can make.\n\nPS - You may also want to join over 2000+ other engineers and tech leaders who get my free weekly newsletter.

"Your IT/tech job descriptions might be turning candidates away. 🛑\n\nThis is how to fix them! ✅\n\n➡️ 1. Start with a clear job title\nAvoid jargon or creative titles that confuse candidates. A straightforward job title like ""Software Engineer"" performs better in search results and aligns with candidate expectations.\n\n➡️ 2. Include a strong opening summary\nSummarize the role in 2-3 sentences. Focus on the core purpose of the job and how it contributes to the company’s goals, keeping it concise and engaging.\n\n➡️ 3. Outline key responsibilities clearly\nList the main tasks in bullet points. Be specific to avoid ambiguity—avoid general phrases like ""handle IT projects"" and specify the exact responsibilities.\n\n➡️ 4. Focus on day-to-day activities\nPaint a picture of a typical day in the role. This helps candidates visualize the job and assess if it's the right fit for them.\n\n➡️ 5. Specify required skills and technologies\nClearly list must-have technical skills, such as Python, SQL, or AWS. This filters candidates early and saves time for both parties.\n\n➡️ 6. Differentiate between ‘required’ and ‘preferred’ skills\nClearly label ""must-have"" versus ""nice-to-have"" skills. This helps attract qualified applicants while keeping the door open for those who may have potential.\n\n➡️ 7. Set realistic expectations for experience levels\nBe precise about the experience level required—whether it's entry-level or senior. Avoid broad terms like ""junior"" or ""experienced"" without clear year-based guidelines.\n\n➡️ 8. Explain the purpose of the role\nDescribe why the role exists and how it fits into the company's broader goals. This provides context and meaning, motivating the right candidates to apply.\n\n➡️ 9. Highlight career growth opportunities\nMention internal development programs or career paths. Candidates want to know how they can progress within your company, especially in a fast-paced industry like IT.\n\n➡️ 10. Provide a clear reporting structure\nState who the candidate will report to. This helps candidates understand where the role fits in the organizational hierarchy and clarifies team dynamics.\n\n... and 14 further must-read tips in the carousel below!\n\n…more"
"Did you recently get passed over for a role you thought you were a perfect fit for? Job hunting can be a challenging journey, and rejection, while tough, is often part of the process. Instead of letting frustration take over, take a step back and assess your approach. Are there areas where you could refine your strategy? Below are a few insights that might help you turn things around and boost your chances for success.\n\n1. Are You Aiming Too High?\nOne common mistake candidates make is applying for roles that may be slightly out of reach. It’s natural to want to push for the next level in your career, but are your qualifications truly aligned with the position you’re applying for?\n\nIf you find yourself consistently passed over for roles that require more experience or a broader skill set, it might be time to reassess and realign. Consider seeking a company with a clear advancement policy or a position that will help bridge the gap between where you are now and where you want to go. Remember: career growth is a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n2. Have You Updated and Tailored Your Resume?\nYour resume is the first impression you make on potential employers. Have you taken the time to thoroughly update it before submitting your applications? A rushed, generic resume could be the reason you’re not getting callbacks.\n\nThink carefully about the content you’re showcasing. Are you just listing broad job duties, or are you clearly communicating your achievements and the value you've added in your previous roles? Employers want to see specific examples of how you’ve contributed to the success of your past organizations. Instead of simply stating “responsible for managing a team,” try adding more depth: “Led a team of 8 to successfully implement a project that resulted in a 15% increase in operational efficiency.”\n\nRefine each bullet point, focusing on accomplishments and measurable outcomes that highlight your unique value.\n\n3. Are You Preparing for Interviews?\nWinging it simply won’t cut it. The competition is fierce, and preparation is key. If you’re not taking the time to prepare for interviews, you’re missing out on one of your best chances to shine.\n\nThink about your most significant career achievements—those moments that truly made an impact at your previous companies. Be ready to share specific metrics, numbers, and examples that demonstrate your value.\n\nIt’s also important to keep your answers concise. Hiring managers often have limited time, so make sure you’re answering questions thoroughly without going off on tangents. Practice telling your stories in a clear, impactful way that highlights your expertise while remaining focused on the relevant details.\n\n4. Bonus: Explore Interview Tips from Experts\nIf you’re feeling stuck or unsure about how to best prepare for interviews, consider checking out resources like Janet Jones’ profile for a series of valuable tips on acing interviews.\n…more"

"Here are my top tips to make your resume stand out!! The goal is clarity and readability. A well-organised, professional resume creates a positive first impression and helps employers quickly see why you're a strong candidate.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I'll also provide tips on what to avoid including in your resume and seek your input on some debatable topics you might believe should be included.\n\nSTART WITH THE BASICS - Create a clear, professional header with your name, in a larger font, (your header is the first thing employers will notice) and include in a smaller font your phone number and email for easy readability.\n\nSUMMARY - Include a brief summary under your header highlighting your skills, experience, and career goals to showcase and make a strong first impression that you’re the right fit for the job.\n\nSKILLS - Highlight relevant expertise here, tailoring them to the job description and including transferable skills.\n\nHIGHLIGHT YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS AND EDUCATION- List your degrees, certifications, courses, languages, awards, key achievements, professional memberships, accreditations, and volunteer work.\n\nSOFTWARE – List all software programs you’ve used in a separate section under your achievements.\n\nCAREER SUMMARY TABLE – Provide a VERY BRIEF snapshot of your past roles under your listed software, including job title, company, and dates worked. Start with your most recent roles, and include your expanded detailed tasks separately on the following pages.\n\nEMPLOYMENT HISTORY\n⦿ Include company name, job title, promotions, exact dates, and if a permanent or a contract role.\n⦿ Keep your resume concise - 1-3 pages max, or up to 4 if you have over 20 years of experience. List the last 15 years of experience in reverse order, condensing older roles past 15 years unless they are relevant to the job.\n⦿ Dot point tasks - Write in first person without ""I,"" e.g., “Scheduled and organised client appointments.”\n⦿ Make it precise and measurable - saying “increased sales by 20%” is more impactful than “improved sales”, instead of “updating clients,” say “updated 60 clients weekly.”\n⦿ Include specific skills and highlight keywords from the job description in your resume to showcase your relevant experience.\n⦿ Briefly explain employment gaps, whether due to travel, study, COVID, redundancy, family, or other reasons.\n\nFORMATTING - Use a consistent 10-12 pt font, bold headers only, bullet points for tasks, and a professional font like Times New Roman or Arial. If using lines, keep them thin and light-coloured.\n\nPROOFREAD – Print or read your resume aloud to spot errors, and have a detail-oriented friend review it.\n\nFINISHING TOUCHES - Name it properly, using your name followed by ""Resume” and save your resume as a PDF to maintain its format.\n\n""MOST IMPORTANTLY"", BE HONEST - Honesty is key to your resume. Dishonesty can harm your chances and reputation. Stay truthful!\n…more"

"In today’s competitive job market, your resume is often your first impression with potential employers—and it needs to shine. But what if writing isn’t your strength? That’s where hiring a professional resume writer can be a game-changer. However, not all resume writers are created equal, and investing in the wrong one could leave you frustrated or, worse, still unemployed.\n\nBefore you commit, here are three essential questions to ask to ensure you’re making the right choice:\n\n1. What is their experience and expertise?\nNot every resume writer understands your specific field or career goals. Ask about their professional background and how long they’ve been writing resumes. Look for someone who understands your industry and has a proven track record of success. Bonus points if they’ve worked in recruiting or HR—they’ll have insider knowledge of what hiring managers are looking for.\n\n2. How do they tailor resumes to individual clients?\nAvoid writers who rely on generic templates or canned phrases. A great resume writer will ask in-depth questions about your experience, achievements, and career goals. Their goal should be to tell your unique story while ensuring your resume passes applicant tracking systems (ATS). Be wary of anyone who promises a one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n3. Can they provide examples, reviews, or testimonials?\nReputable resume writers will gladly share client testimonials or samples of their work. Seeing evidence of their ability to produce results can give you peace of mind. If they’re unwilling to provide this, it might be a red flag.\n________________________________\n\nA resume is an investment in your career, and choosing the right professional can make all the difference. Asking these questions ensures that you’re selecting someone who understands your needs and can deliver real value.\n\nWant even more tips on hiring the best resume writer?

"""You’re Not Getting Hired Because You’re Forgetting This ONE Thing""\n\nMost job seekers are stuck in a never-ending loop:\nApply. Wait. Hope. Repeat.\n\nAnd when they don’t get hired, they blame the economy, the job market, or even bad luck. But here’s the truth:\nIt’s not the market. It’s your strategy.\nHere’s what top recruiters won’t tell you: Your resume isn’t just a piece of paper—it’s your business card for a six-figure opportunity. Yet, most job seekers treat it like a last-minute college essay.\nThink about this:\nWould Apple sell an iPhone in a plain cardboard box?\nWould Nike slap a logo on a plain sneaker and hope for the best?\nNo.\nThey tell a story. They highlight the value. They sell the vision.\nNow, let me ask you this:\nDoes your resume sell YOU as the premium, top-tier professional you are? Or is it just a list of tasks you did 3 years ago?\nBecause here’s the thing: recruiters don’t read resumes, they SKIM. And if you can’t grab their attention in 6 seconds, you’re already in the “no” pile.\nHere’s what to do instead:\nTell a story: Don’t just list responsibilities—show results. Instead of “Managed a team,” write, “Led a team of 10 to increase productivity by 25% in 6 months.”\nMake it skimmable: Use bullet points, bold key achievements, and highlight metrics.\nPosition yourself as the solution: Every job listing is a problem. Your resume should scream, “I’m the answer!”\n\nStop thinking like an applicant and start thinking like a business. Because here’s the hard truth:\nThere is no success with “almost.” Either you’re the obvious choice—or you’re invisible.\n\nIf you’ve been struggling to land interviews, it’s not the job—it’s the approach. Fix that, and watch doors open.\n\nWhat’s stopping you from leveling up your resume today? Let’s talk!\n\n…more"

"Here are some common resume pitfalls transitioning military job seekers fall into:\n\n🚩 1. The ‘One-Size-Fits-All’ Resume\n\nUsing the same generic resume for every job application is a surefire way to get ignored.\n\nSolution: Tailor your resume to each job by aligning your skills and experience with the job description.\n\n🚩 2. No Metrics, No Proof\n\nSaying you ""improved processes"" in the military is vague. Saying you ""increased efficiency by 30% and reduced costs by $50K"" is impactful.\n\nSolution: Use quantifiable achievements to show your value.\n\n🚩 3. The Job Description Copy-Paste Trap\n\nRegurgitating your job duties from a military or corporate role isn't compelling.\n\nSolution: Translate responsibilities into accomplishments. Hiring managers want to know how you made an impact, not just what you were assigned to do. Make sure to use action verbs, metrics, and show results.\n\n🚩 4. Too Much Military/Career Jargon\n\nDon't use military jargon and acronyms that civilians don't understand.\nIf your resume reads like a mission report, it won’t resonate with civilian recruiters.\n\nSolution: Simplify terminology and explain how your skills transfer to the industry you’re targeting.\n\n🚩 5. Keyword Deficiency\n\nMany resumes get rejected by recruiters because you are not proving how you meet the skills nor address the key words listed in the job description.\n\nSolution: Don't just list all of your previous job responsibilities, use relevant industry keywords and skills from the job description, and SHOW how you've done THAT thing they want you to know how to do.\n\nA resume isn’t just a piece of paper; it’s your personal marketing document.\n\nAvoid these mistakes, and you’ll get closer to landing an interview.\n\nMaloney out! ✌\n\n\n\n\n…more"

"🌟 Boost Your Job Search with the Power of High-Quality Recommendations 🌟\n\nIn a competitive job market, one of the most effective ways to get your resume noticed is through your network and their recommendations. A well-timed and thoughtful recommendation can make all the difference.\n\nHere’s how you can leverage this to your advantage:\n\n1. Give Your Connections a Heads-Up – If you're planning to mention someone in an interview, let them know in advance.

No one likes to be caught off guard, and you'll get a much stronger, tailored recommendation in return.\n\n2. Be Proactive in Supporting Others – If you recommend someone to a recruiter or headhunter, make sure to tell them! Why? It adds real value to the recruiter's message and strengthens your relationship for future recommendations.\n\n3. Reach Out to An Employee for ☕ - Over the years, I have had networking coffees and virtual chats that have grown into referrals and job opportunities.\n\nRemember, building strong, supportive relationships within your network isn’t just about what others can do for you — it’s about mutual support and helping one another thrive.\n\n…more"

Let’s bust six of the most common resume myths and set the record straight:\n\n1. Your Resume Must Be One Page\nNot true! If you have substantial experience, it’s okay to go up to two pages. What matters is how relevant and concise your content is.\n\n2. Gaps in Your Resume Are Dealbreakers\nLife happens! As long as you address gaps confidently and show how you stayed active or grew during them, it won’t sink your chances.\n\n3. You Always Need References\nNope! Employers typically ask for references after you’ve made it through the initial stages. Keep them on hand but off your resume.\n\n4. Your Resume Should Be ""Unique""\nA flashy, one-of-a-kind resume isn’t necessary unless you’re in a creative field. Focus on clarity and relevance instead of gimmicks.\n\n5. You Have to List Your Full Address\nThe days of snail mail are over! Just list your city and state—no need for your full address.\n\n6. Dates and Employer Names Aren’t Important\nThink again!

"When I started looking for a job, people said I should apply to a lot of them. But it didn't work out that way. I applied to many jobs and often got no response.\n\nWhy? Because when we rush, we sometimes miss important details about what the job needs. It's like trying to hit a target without looking.\n\nInstead of applying to tons of jobs randomly, it's better to focus on a few. Take time to understand what the job is about and what the company wants. Then, change your resume to match that. Make it fit what the company is looking for.\n\nIt's not about sending out a bunch of resumes—it's about sending the right ones. Quality is more important than quantity. If you match your resume with the job, you're more likely to get a call.\n\nSo, don't worry about applying everywhere. It's not a race. Take your time, understand the job, and then make your move.

"📄 Resume Tips from a Recruiter (Take Them or Leave Them - could be my opinions only, so I welcome any other recruiters to chime in!)\n\nI’ve been deep in resume reviews over the past few weeks, and a few things have stood out. So, in the spirit of kindness and humor, here are some unsolicited tips to (hopefully) help you stand out in the best way possible:\n\n🎨 Go easy on the colors. A small splash of color? Cool. A rainbow? Distracting. Subtle and professional is the way to go.\n📜 Get to the good stuff quickly. I promise, most recruiters don’t spend much time on those paragraphs or “highlight” sections at the top. Put your experience front and center—I want to see what you’ve done without scrolling through a novel first.\n⚠️ Meet the minimum requirements (and be honest). If the role requires X, Y, and Z, please have X, Y, and Z. And lying on preliminary questions? Just don’t. It’s awkward for everyone.\n📊 Skip the charts, graphs, and graphics. They look fancy, but honestly, I usually scroll right past them. They don’t always add the value you think they do.\n✂️ Less is more. A focused, impactful resume beats one crammed with every single task you’ve ever done. Prioritize metrics and achievements—they’re your best friends.\n📸 No pictures, please. That space is better used for you—your experience, skills, and what makes you a great candidate.\n💡 I know the job market is tough right now, and it can be hard to know what works. I hope these tips are helpful as you polish up your resume. And know this: I’m rooting for you all!\nGood luck out there—you’ve got this! 💪\n…more"

Keep it Precise - Especially for freshers, it’s tempting to include everything. But remember, less is more. Seek advice from professionals in your field or a consultant to streamline your content and keep it relevant.\n\n2. Leverage AI Tools - Don’t miss out on the power of design! Use AI platforms to give your CV a polished, modern look. Plenty of templates are available, and a well-designed CV stands out.\n\n3. Formatting Matters - Ensure your CV is easy to read. Poor formatting—like mismatched fonts, inconsistent alignments, and heavy borders—can overwhelm the reader. Keep it clean and simple.\n\n4. Spell Check, Always - A CV with spelling or grammatical errors sends the wrong message. Always double-check and, if possible, ask someone else to review it too.\n\n5. Highlight Relevant Interests & Achievements - Tailor your CV to the role you're applying for. Sure, your singing talent is great, but if you’re applying for a finance role, highlighting your interest in business, finance, or the stock market will capture the recruiter’s attention.\n\n|| Brownie Tip ||\n\nUse an ATS-Friendly Format - Here's a tip most people don't know—make sure your CV is ATS-friendly (Applicant Tracking System). Many companies use ATS to filter CVs before they even reach a hiring manager. Stick to standard fonts, avoid images or complex formatting, and use keywords from the job description to increase your chances of passing the automated screening.\n\nRemember, a well-crafted CV isn’t just a list of qualifications—it’s your story in a nutshell. Spend the time to make it shine, and you’ll find yourself one step closer to that dream job.\n\nHuge thanks tofor sharing her insights on the concept of ""ATS/STAR format."" I really appreciate the knowledge and perspective!\n\n…more"

"✨ Use Your Words Wisely – Especially on Your Resume! ✨\nHave you ever been told to use your words wisely? This advice doesn’t just apply to conversations—it’s crucial when crafting your resume.\nWhen I come across a resume packed with words, no matter how well-written, it often misses the mark. Why? It doesn’t tell your story. A resume like that could belong to anyone.\nTo make your resume uniquely yours, focus on these key elements:\n🔹 Scope: Describe your role—what was the scale of your responsibilities? What volume or team size did you manage?\n🔹 Success: Highlight your achievements. What results did you deliver? What makes you stand out?\n🔹 Recognition: Were you the “Manager of the Year”? The go-to person for a major initiative? Share it!\nQuantify your accomplishments with numbers, symbols, KPIs, and specifics to show your impact. Once you master this, you’ll never view resumes the same way again.\nLet’s compare two examples:\n1️⃣ Strategic leader, hands-on with the team, developing client-centric initiatives to deliver an exceptional client experience.\n2️⃣ Strategic leader, motivating teams to deliver exceptional service, resulting in a 14% sales increase YOY and growing appointment business from 8% to 17% of total sales.\nThe second example tells a story. It’s clear, measurable, and impactful—and it speaks volumes about the candidate's contributions.\n💡 Remember: Your resume should showcase your unique journey, not just a generic job description.\nWhat are your tips for crafting a standout resume?

"There is one phrase you should NEVER say to someone who is unemployed due to a layoff or something outside of their control.\n\n""Enjoy your time off!""\n\nAh yes....because losing your job is the all expenses paid vacation that NOBODY asked for.\n\nLet's be real:\n\n❌ Bills don't take a vacation. Rent, groceries, and student loans didn’t seem to get the memo that you're “off work.”\n\n❌ Job searching is a full-time job. Updating resumes, networking, and applying to 10-15 jobs a day isn't sipping margaritas on the beach.\n\n❌ Stress levels are high when you are unemployed and ""relaxing"" is tough when you are wondering how long your savings account will last.\n\nInstead of telling someone to ""enjoy"" their time off, try saying this instead:\n\n✅ ""How can I support you?""\n✅ ""Who can I introduce you to in my network that can help?""\n✅ ""If you need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to reach out.""\n\nBeing unemployed is anything but a vacation.\n\nThese jobseekers didn't ask for this time off.\n\nThey want to get back to work.\n\nLet's continue to support these jobseekers instead of giving them a ""silver lining"" speech.\n\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWant more authentic job searching tips and career advice in your news feed?\n\nSmash the 🔔 on my page so you don't miss my posts!\n\nIf you are spinning your wheels on your job search, my companyoffers hands-on career coaching sessions and other services including resume writing, interview practice, Linkedin Profile Optimization and more!\n\nSchedule your free 15-minute discovery call using the link at the top of my page and let's ROCK your job search!\n…more"
"DEAR JOB SEEKERS\n\nTHIS IS WHAT INCREASES YOUR CV SCORE ON THE APPLICANT TRACKING SYSTEM (ATS)\n\n1) SKILLS:\nYou can either have skills in your career objective, job bullet points, separate section or you can have skills in all the above mentioned.\n\n2) LINKEDIN URL:\nAdding a hyperlink to your Linkedin Profile will help you share information about yourself that might be too much for your CV.\n\n3) CONTACT NUMBER AND E-MAIL ADDRESS\nTip: Employers will use either of these two to communicate, make sure the email address spelling is correct and the numbers aren’t swapped around.\n\n4) FILE NAME:\nAlways use your First Name and Surname, using anything else might cause your CV to be discarded or marked off as suspicious.\n\n5) FILE SIZE\nThe file must be under 2 mb. If your CV is bigger than 2 mb you need to remove attachments (copies of qualifications, cover page pictures, photos) or simply re-save it in a different format that will allow for file compression.\n\n6) FILE TYPE:\nThe recommended file type to use is PDF (Not scanned), you must be able to highlight the text. Word can be used as well but PDF will cause the least problems.\n\n7) DATE FORMATTING:\nInclude the month and year for both the start and the end date, the most recent experience being at the top going down.\n\nHave a productive day job seekers, you’re all winners for not giving up!\n\n…more"

"Recruiters don’t read resumes—they scan them.\n\nThat means if yours doesn’t grab attention in seconds, it’s getting skipped.\n\nSo, what actually makes a recruiter stop and take a second look?\n\nHere’s a breakdown of how they think:\n\n1️⃣ The 6-Second Rule\n→ Recruiters aren’t reading essays. They skim for key details.\n\n2️⃣ Your Top Half Matters Most\n→ Name, title, contact info, LinkedIn and a compelling professional summary should be on the top.\n\n3️⃣ Strategic Keywords\n→ Use industry-specific terms in your headline and summary. If they don’t see relevant skills fast, you’re out.\n\n4️⃣ Showcase Your Expertise\n→ Your headline should highlight what you bring to the table, not just your job title.\n\n5️⃣ Clean, Readable Formatting\n→ If your resume looks cluttered, it won’t get read. Stick to clear fonts, white space, and a structured layout.\n\nThink of your resume as a first impression.
