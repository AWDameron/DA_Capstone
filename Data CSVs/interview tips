Can you make them speak? Power BI, Tableau, or Looker—whichever tool, the goal is clarity.\n✅ Business & Product Thinking – Data isn’t just numbers. It’s a tool to solve business problems. Can you connect the dots?\n✅ Cloud & ETL Basics – Snowflake, BigQuery, Alteryx, dbt—knowing how data flows matters. Even basic knowledge gives you an edge.\n✅ Clear Communication – If you can explain a complex insight to someone with zero data background, you win.\n\n⚠️ What to Avoid Saying:\n❌ “I know everything.” – No one does. Not even AI. Stay humble, stay curious.\n❌ “I can learn Python in a week.” – Learning never stops, but be realistic. Depth matters.\n❌ “I love data.” – That’s great, but so does everyone applying.

"Two people applied for the same computational biologist job last year. They both also happened to share their resume with me for feedback. One of them (A) did NOT get an interview. The other one (B) did. What made the difference?\n\nThe job description (JD) specifically asked for the following experience (among many others):\n- Lead efforts to expand the immune cell atlas by incorporating single-cell RNA-seq data from various tissues.\n- Refine cell type annotations to increase the granularity of the atlas, improving the ability to distinguish subtle differences between immune cell subsets across tissues.\n\nA’s resume says:\n- Conducted single-cell and bulk RNA seq analysis on tumor and adjacent normal tissues to identify inflammatory cells driving racial disparities in lung cancer.\n- Utilized single-cell gene signatures to deconvolute the bulk data for improved risk assessment and targeted treatment strategies in high-risk minority populations.\n\nB’s resume says:\n- Grew internal single-cell RNA-seq database to 17M+ cells spanning 200+ studies. Improved metadata by adding standardized disease ontologies, cell-level annotations, clearer treatment history, and TCR/BCR clonotype information.\n- Created a single-cell RNA-seq reference atlas with dozens of tumor indications with scVI. Used the atlas to automate cell type annotation of new single-cell RNA-seq data with scANVI.\n\nSee the difference? A and B both have relevant experience with the tasks that the JD asked for, but B’s experience was just that much more relevant and specific than A’s.\n\nIn reviewing my back-and-forth messages with A, one phrase I kept using is “immediately apparent”.\n\n“It is not immediately apparent that you have put together large single-cell atlases from distinct sources and standardized cell type annotations, even though you have worked with scRNA-seq data.”\n\nB's resume, on the other hand, made it immediately apparent that they should get the interview.\n\nHopefully this helps people see just how much hiring managers for computational biology roles care about exact fit in this job market.\n\nB actually ended up getting the job and started a few weeks ago.\n\n…more"

"This is probably one of the biggest mistakes I see from Aspiring Data Analysts\n\nThey’ll jump into fancy dashboards, complex queries, and advanced models—yet skip the simplest (but most important) step: understanding the data’s context.\n\nI learned this the hard way.\n\nOne of my very first projects involved analyzing customer churn. I spent a week building SQL queries and cool visualizations. But when I presented the findings, the manager pointed out a glaring gap: I didn’t even consider the industry’s unique sales cycle. Half of my recommendations were useless because I never bothered to learn the business side.\n\nThe lesson?\n\nEven a perfect query can have wrong insights if you don’t know your domain.\n\nDon’t just analyze rows and columns in a vacuum—ask about the story behind the data, the business process that produces it, and the real-life implications of your numbers.\n\nI see a lot of analysts focusing on what the data looks like, rather than why it looks that way. They collect KPIs without fully grasping how they tie back to actual challenges in marketing, finance, or ops.\n\nSure, mastering technical skills is crucial. But if you’re not linking your analysis to real-world context, you'll NEVER truly understand the business\n\nSo here’s my question for YOU: Which approach has made the biggest difference in your career—knowing every function and formula, or deeply understanding the business behind the data?\n\nI know which changed my results.

"Data Analytics Isn’t Just About Numbers—It’s About Asking the Right Questions\n\nIn my years as a Senior Executive in Business Intelligence, I’ve learned that technical skills alone don’t make a great data analyst—the ability to ask the right questions does.\n\nBefore diving into dashboards or reports, it’s crucial to understand:\n🔹 What business problem are we solving?\n🔹 Which insights will truly impact decision-making?\n🔹 What KPIs matter most?\n\nSkipping this step can lead to impressive-looking reports that don’t drive real impact. In my latest project, asking the right questions turned a basic sales dashboard into a powerful decision-making tool, helping the team track trends, segment performance, and take real-time action.\n\nThe best analysts don’t just crunch numbers—they uncover valuable insights.\n\n📌 Want to know how?

"Ever walked out of an interview thinking, \n“I could’ve answered that so much better” 🤔 ? \n\nYeah, me too.\n\nThe truth is, most of us don’t fail interviews because we’re not good enough, we fail because we don’t know how to communicate our value the right way.\n\nAnd I learned this the hard way.\n\nBack when I first started preparing for interviews, I thought “just be yourself” was enough. But reality hit me fast. Interviews are a skill, and like any skill, you get better with practice.\n\nOne resource that helped me a lot was The Interview Guide School by Jason Kwok Yuan Long. I’ve had it for a long time. Here are some helpful tips you can take note of:\n\n🔹 Stop “describing” your experience, start proving your impact.\nSaying “I managed projects” isn’t enough.\nInstead, say:\n➡️ “I led a team of 5 to complete a project 2 weeks ahead of schedule, saving 20% in costs.”\nShow the numbers, show the impact.\n\n🔹 Nail the “Tell me about yourself” question.\nThis is NOT your autobiography.\nThink of it as your 30-second personal brand pitch:\n✅ Who you are professionally\n✅ What you bring to the table\n✅ Why they should care\n\n🔹 Confidence is built before the interview\nI used to overthink every answer, but preparation changed everything. Record yourself, practice with a friend, or even talk to yourself in the mirror (yes, I’ve done this). The more you practice, the less your nerves control you.\n\n🔹 Ask smart questions because you’re also interviewing them.\nAt the end of the interview, don’t just sit there waiting to be dismissed.\nAsk:\n❓ “What are the biggest challenges in this role?”\n❓ “How do you define success in the first 6 months?”\nIt shows confidence and makes them remember you.\n\nAt the end of the day, interviews are about impressing people with how well you fit the role.\n\nAgree?\n\n\nHappy Webnesday & stay safe ❤️\n…more"

"The secret to landing that dream job? It's so simple.\n\nNEVER USE PDFs FOR YOUR RESUME. Too easy for your prospective hiring manager to open. Make them work for it. Use a weird format like .BMP or .Tiff. This provides an air of mystery to your resume. ""What could this be? How the hell do I even open a TARGA file in 2025?"" Hiring managers love puzzle solving, so give them something they can really sink their teeth into.\n\nSTART INTERVIEWS BY REVEALING A TRAGIC FAMILY SECRET: You can make one up if you need to. ""My grandpa could have stopped Ted Bundy, but didn't"" is a good one. ""Every one of my uncles is a horse thief"" is more niche, but there's a timeless quality to it. My tip? Have fun with it.\n\nINSIST ON BEING PAID IN RARE JEWELS: Inflation, shmilflation! Sure, it may take a few extra steps, but nothing spends better than a sack full of sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds. Slapping down a topaz at the local five and dime is a real flex.\n\nFORCE YOUR INTERVIEWER TO TAKE A POSITION ON MARTIN LUTHER: Divinely inspired reformer, or blasphemous oaf? Both positions are respectable, but make them take a side, and more importantly, defend it.\n\nEND WITH A SONG: Most interviewers end interviews with ""Do you have any more questions?"" This is when you queue up some music and say, ""Just one: do you enjoy Billy Joel's middle period?"" That's when you can delight them with a rendition of ""Uptown Girl"" or ""Allentown."" Don't go for B-Sides like ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"" or ""Running on Ice"" you'll just be wasting everyone's time.\n\nHope this helps!

"Useful Interview Tips...\n\nI see this almost daily on here, but you’d be surprised how many people still don’t prep properly for their interviews.\n\nI get it—you’ve been in the industry for years, you know your stuff, and you think you can wing it. But no matter how experienced or confident you feel, skipping interview prep is like turning up to a test without revising. You might pass, but why take the risk?\n\nTips I always give my candidates:\n\n✅DO YOUR RESEARCH!!! – How are you turning up to a job interview knowing nothing about the company you could be working for? Check their website, LinkedIn, recent news, and even employee reviews if you can. Make sure you can confidently talk about why you want to work there.\n\n✅ ALWAYS have questions to ask – It’s not just about them interviewing you; you’re also seeing if the role and company are the right fit for you. Ask things like: What do you enjoy about working here? What’s kept you here for so long? What’s the biggest challenge in this role?\n\n✅ Know your CV inside out – If it’s on your CV, be ready to talk about it. If you listed a skill, have an example of how you’ve used it. If you put down responsibilities, be prepared to explain how you handled them.\n\n✅ Dress appropriately – Sounds obvious, but first impressions count. Even if it’s a casual workplace, turning up looking scruffy isn’t a good look. If in doubt, always go smarter.\n\n✅ Be yourself – They’re hiring a person, not just a skillset. Show your personality, be professional but natural, and remember that interviews are just conversations (with slightly higher stakes).\n\nAt the end of the day, preparation = confidence. Go in knowing you’ve done the work, and the rest will follow.\n\n…more"

No insights. No next steps. Just silence.\n\nHere’s how to break the cycle and take back control. 👇\n\nAt the end of your interview, ask this one powerful question:\n\n💡 ""Is there anything about my resume or interview that makes you doubt I’d be a good fit for this role?""\n\nWhy? Because 70%+ of hiring managers have concerns they never voice. 🚨\n\n🔹 This question forces them to reveal any red flags\n🔹 It gives you real-time feedback on where you stand\n🔹 You get a chance to clarify misunderstandings immediately\n\nInstead of waiting weeks for a rejection, you get instant insights.\n\n🚀 Pro Tip: If they mention a concern, don’t panic! Instead, respond with:\n\n✅ ""That’s a great point! Let me clarify...""\n✅ ""I actually have experience with that—let me explain...""\n✅ ""I’d love to share an example to address that...""\n\n💡 When you handle objections live, you increase your hiring chances by 40%+.\n\nNext time, don’t just hope for an offer—ask for the feedback that can get you there. 💼🔥\n\n👇 Have you tried this question before?

"Why rambling on interviews can be holding you back. \n\nRambling during an interview is a common issue that can affect your progress in the hiring process. The candidates who stand out are able to communicate their experiences and skills in a clear, concise, and engaging way.\n\nEarly in my career, I struggled with this too, whether it was in interviews, presentations, or networking. It’s easy to ramble when you’re nervous, or trying to fill silence. But over time, I learned a few key strategies that helped me keep my responses focused and impactful.\n\nHere are some tips that helped me:\n\n1. Practice Positive Affirmations\n\nBefore any interview or presentation, take a moment to remind yourself that you deserve this opportunity, that you're knowledgeable, and that you're ready. Positive affirmations help calm your nerves, reduce anxiety, and give you the confidence to express yourself clearly.\n\n2. Slow Down Your Speech\n\nIt may sound counterintuitive, but slowing down your speaking pace can make a huge difference. When you talk too fast, it's easy to stumble over words or add unnecessary filler. Slowing down not only gives you time to think but also helps you sound more thoughtful and deliberate.\n\n3. Record Yourself\n\nRecording yourself can feel awkward, but it’s one of the most effective ways to improve. Listening to your responses will help you identify areas where you can refine your delivery. If listening to yourself feels uncomfortable, try practicing with a friend for feedback.\n\nTry these tips next time you have an interview or a big presentation and remember this will take practice so don't be hard on yourself.\n\n…more"

"🧐 Common interview mistakes and how to avoid them\n\n👉 Lack of preparation\nCandidates often fail to research the company. Read up on their history, mission, and recent news. This shows genuine interest and can set you apart.\n\n👉 Overlooking the job description\nMake sure you understand the role requirements deeply. Highlight how your experience and skills align with what they need.\n\n👉 Poor body language\nSlouching, avoiding eye contact, or fidgeting can send negative signals. Practise confident, calm, and positive body language.\n\n👉 Talking too much (or too little)\nAim for balanced responses. Be concise but provide enough detail to showcase your abilities. It's a conversation, not a monologue.\n\n👉 Not asking questions\nShow curiosity and engagement by asking insightful questions about the role and the company. It shows you're seriously considering the position.\n\n👉 Ignoring cultural fit\nResearching the company's culture can help you assess if you'd thrive there. Mention how your values align with theirs.\n\nRemember, interviews are as much about fit as they are about skills.

"💥💥💥Interviewing 101💥💥💥 \n\nHere are the top tips/ tricks I like to relay to candidates before they interview with one of my clients.\n\n1. Do your research so you can speak to why you are interested in THIS company and THIS role. Review the company’s website. Look at the interviewer’s LI profile so you understand their background. Be prepared with examples of how your experience aligns with the bullet points on the job description.\n\n2. Dress to impress. Dress to impress. Dress to impress. Our culture has gone quite casual since COVID, but I’d rather you be overdressed for the interview than underdressed. You can get casual once you’ve gotten the job.\n\n3. Come prepared with a ton of questions. Yes, you will likely get the majority of those questions answered simply through the conversation, but it’s important to have questions prepared so at the end of the interview, when the interviewer asks you what questions you have, you have some!\n\n4. You CAN have questions/ thoughts written out next to you (shocker!) An interview is not a test. Consulting your padfolio for questions or thoughts shows that you have done your prep for the interview, have invested the time and are truly interested.\n\n5. If still interested in the opportunity as the interview wraps up, let the interviewer know at the end of the interview! I think a lot of candidates get superstitious and want to hold their excitement close to the vest. People hire people they like. And people like people who want to work with them! So if you are interested, let them know.\n\n6. Send a thank you email by EOD. It’s noticeable if you don’t. Take the five minutes and send one.\n\n7. An interview is as much for you as it is for the client. It’s totally okay to interview and conclude you aren’t interested in moving forward.\n\nI send these, as well as additional tips and attachments, to every candidate that is interviewing for a job through me. If you’d be interested in a copy of my standard prep email, please let me know – just shoot me an email or comment here and I can get it in your inbox.\n\nHappy interviewing!\n\n29/100\n…more"

"👉 How to Structure a Development Plan for Data Analysts\n\nOne of the most impactful things a team manager can do is help junior team members grow with a structured development plan.\n\nWhile technical skills are crucial, being a great data analyst goes beyond just knowing SQL or Python.\n\nFor a Data Analyst, I believe a great growth plan should cover these key areas:\n\n✅ Business Knowledge\n\nUnderstanding how data fits into business processes is crucial. I always emphasize CRISP-DM for structuring analytical thinking and encourage learning industry-specific terminology to communicate effectively with stakeholders.\n\n✅ Technical Skills\n\nMastering the company's current tech stack is essential, along with preparing for upcoming tools. Regardless of the stack, SQL, Python, and visualization skills are crucial.\n\n✅ Research Skills\n\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a must-have. Analysts should learn to diagnose and resolve data issues, identify patterns, and identify root causes of anomalies in datasets.\n\n✅ Reporting & Documentation\n\nNumbers alone don't tell a story. A great analyst provides context by documenting the purpose, calculation logic, and business relevance of KPIs. Creating user-friendly guides helps stakeholders navigate dashboards without confusion.\n\n✅ Presentation & Visualization\n\nEffective visuals simplify insights. One key rule: one takeaway per visualization. Avoid overcrowding charts with excessive data, less is often more!\n\n✅ Storytelling\n\nData is only useful when it drives decisions. A compelling analyst transforms data into a narrative, answering the what, why, and how behind the insights.\n…more"

We extract data using techniques such as:\n\nExtracting structured data using SQL\nCollecting unstructured data through web scraping or API integrations from website. Then we combine all datasets into a centralized repository (e.g., Excel or CSV)\n\nStep 4: Clean data\n\nBy dropping columns with excessive missing values (e.g., 80%)\nUsing imputation methods to replace missing values\nRemoving duplicates and standardizing text formats\n\nStep 5: Analyze the Data\n\nWith our data in hand, we employ various analytical techniques to uncover insights and patterns, including:\n\nDescriptive statistics to summarize trends\nCorrelation analysis to identify relationships between factors\nSentiment analysis to understand customer emotions in reviews\n\nStep 6: Visualize the Findings\n\nWe communicate our findings through compelling visualizations, using:\n\nBar charts to illustrate complaints by product category\nLine graphs to track customer satisfaction over time\n\nStep 7: Communicate Insights and Recommendations\n\nFinally, we present a summary of our findings and provide actionable recommendations to stakeholders, using:\n\nPowerPoint or Google Slides presentations\nInteractive dashboards in Power BI or Tableau\nSummary reports in PDF or Word format, highlighting key takeaways\n\nA huge thank you to Esther Emoekpenefor their guidance.\n…more"
