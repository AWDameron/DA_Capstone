Her SQL skills, data visualization samples, and architecture and design knowledge were excellent.

But her resume had a 3-year gap.

When I asked if she had any questions in the final interview, she said something that hit me:

""I'm surprised you didn't drill me about my employment gap. Every other company has.""

One of my mentor once told me:

'Life is messy. What matters is who you are today and where you're going.'

That manager took a chance on me when I lacked the skill, and I became his most successful hire that year.

Three months in, she's already leading our customer analytics overhaul.

Here’s what I’ve learned:
→ Non-traditional paths build exceptional talent.
→ Perfect resumes don’t tell the whole story.

If we fixate on gaps, we miss resilient people who’ve faced challenges and come back stronger.

Our team's diversity - in background, experience, and perspective - has transformed our innovation.

In my years as a Senior Executive in Business Intelligence, I’ve learned that technical skills alone don’t make a great data analyst—the ability to ask the right questions does.

Before diving into dashboards or reports, it’s crucial to understand:
🔹 What business problem are we solving?
🔹 Which insights will truly impact decision-making?
🔹 What KPIs matter most?

Skipping this step can lead to impressive-looking reports that don’t drive real impact. In my latest project, asking the right questions turned a basic sales dashboard into a powerful decision-making tool, helping the team track trends, segment performance, and take real-time action.

What stands out to me is the importance of curiosity and storytelling. As Data Analysts, we don’t just analyze data; we uncover stories hidden within it and communicate those insights in a way that drives decision-making. It’s a perfect blend of technical expertise and people skills.
What do you think is the most crucial skill for a Data Analyst? Let’s discuss! 👇

Your first Data Analyst interview is here. You’re excited. Maybe a little nervous. That’s normal.
But beyond just knowing SQL, Python, and dashboards, what you say (and don’t say) can shape the outcome.

💡 What to Focus On:
✅ SQL That Works in the Real World – Writing queries is one thing. Writing efficient queries? That’s where the magic is. Window functions, CTEs, query optimization these matter.
✅ Data Visualization That Tells a Story – Anyone can make charts. Can you make them speak? Power BI, Tableau, or Looker—whichever tool, the goal is clarity.
✅ Business & Product Thinking – Data isn’t just numbers. It’s a tool to solve business problems. Can you connect the dots?
✅ Cloud & ETL Basics – Snowflake, BigQuery, Alteryx, dbt—knowing how data flows matters. Even basic knowledge gives you an edge.
✅ Clear Communication – If you can explain a complex insight to someone with zero data background, you win.

⚠️ What to Avoid Saying:
❌ “I know everything.” – No one does. Not even AI. Stay humble, stay curious.
❌ “I can learn Python in a week.” – Learning never stops, but be realistic. Depth matters.
❌ “I love data.” – That’s great, but so does everyone applying. Show why it matters in your work.
❌ Buzzwords overload. – Fancy terms won’t help if your answers aren’t clear. Keep it simple, keep it sharp.

At the end of the day, they’re not just hiring skills. They’re hiring mindset, problem-solving, and adaptability.
Go in with clarity. Stay confident. And most importantly be yourself.

…more","Two people applied for the same computational biologist job last year. They both also happened to share their resume with me for feedback. One of them (A) did NOT get an interview. The other one (B) did. What made the difference?

The job description (JD) specifically asked for the following experience (among many others):
- Lead efforts to expand the immune cell atlas by incorporating single-cell RNA-seq data from various tissues.
- Refine cell type annotations to increase the granularity of the atlas, improving the ability to distinguish subtle differences between immune cell subsets across tissues.

A’s resume says:
- Conducted single-cell and bulk RNA seq analysis on tumor and adjacent normal tissues to identify inflammatory cells driving racial disparities in lung cancer.
- Utilized single-cell gene signatures to deconvolute the bulk data for improved risk assessment and targeted treatment strategies in high-risk minority populations.

B’s resume says:
- Grew internal single-cell RNA-seq database to 17M+ cells spanning 200+ studies. Improved metadata by adding standardized disease ontologies, cell-level annotations, clearer treatment history, and TCR/BCR clonotype information.
- Created a single-cell RNA-seq reference atlas with dozens of tumor indications with scVI. Used the atlas to automate cell type annotation of new single-cell RNA-seq data with scANVI.

See the difference? A and B both have relevant experience with the tasks that the JD asked for, but B’s experience was just that much more relevant and specific than A’s.

In reviewing my back-and-forth messages with A, one phrase I kept using is “immediately apparent”.

“It is not immediately apparent that you have put together large single-cell atlases from distinct sources and standardized cell type annotations, even though you have worked with scRNA-seq data.”

B's resume, on the other hand, made it immediately apparent that they should get the interview.

Hopefully this helps people see just how much hiring managers for computational biology roles care about exact fit in this job market.

B actually ended up getting the job and started a few weeks ago.

…more","This is probably one of the biggest mistakes I see from Aspiring Data Analysts

They’ll jump into fancy dashboards, complex queries, and advanced models—yet skip the simplest (but most important) step: understanding the data’s context.

I learned this the hard way.

One of my very first projects involved analyzing customer churn. I spent a week building SQL queries and cool visualizations. But when I presented the findings, the manager pointed out a glaring gap: I didn’t even consider the industry’s unique sales cycle. Half of my recommendations were useless because I never bothered to learn the business side.

The lesson?

Even a perfect query can have wrong insights if you don’t know your domain.

Don’t just analyze rows and columns in a vacuum—ask about the story behind the data, the business process that produces it, and the real-life implications of your numbers.

I see a lot of analysts focusing on what the data looks like, rather than why it looks that way. They collect KPIs without fully grasping how they tie back to actual challenges in marketing, finance, or ops.

Sure, mastering technical skills is crucial. But if you’re not linking your analysis to real-world context, you'll NEVER truly understand the business

So here’s my question for YOU: Which approach has made the biggest difference in your career—knowing every function and formula, or deeply understanding the business behind the data?

I know which changed my results. What about you?

↳ Before your interview, print out your resume and job description to have as a quick reference. Jot down a few key points about the role, your experience, and your questions.

💙 Say Affirmations
↳ Positive affirmations work wonders for boosting your confidence and calming your nerves. Remind yourself of your value and abilities!

Her SQL skills, data visualization samples, and architecture and design knowledge were excellent.

👉 Most people walk into an interview just trying to answer questions—but the ones who really stand out are the ones who come in ready to ask the right ones.

Back when I was a recruiter at
, I saw it all.

The candidates who nailed it weren’t just listing their skills. They were showing they actually cared about:
➞ The role
➞ The team
➞ Making an impact.

And then there were the ones who didn’t ask anything… which honestly made me wonder if they even wanted the job.

Asking smart, strategic questions makes you memorable and shows you’re thinking beyond just getting hired.

…more","Ever walked out of an interview thinking, 
“I could’ve answered that so much better” 🤔 ? 

Yeah, me too.

The truth is, most of us don’t fail interviews because we’re not good enough, we fail because we don’t know how to communicate our value the right way.

And I learned this the hard way.

Back when I first started preparing for interviews, I thought “just be yourself” was enough. But reality hit me fast. Interviews are a skill, and like any skill, you get better with practice.

One resource that helped me a lot was The Interview Guide School by Jason Kwok Yuan Long. I’ve had it for a long time. Here are some helpful tips you can take note of:

🔹 Stop “describing” your experience, start proving your impact.
Saying “I managed projects” isn’t enough.
Instead, say:
➡️ “I led a team of 5 to complete a project 2 weeks ahead of schedule, saving 20% in costs.”
Show the numbers, show the impact.

🔹 Nail the “Tell me about yourself” question.
This is NOT your autobiography.
Think of it as your 30-second personal brand pitch:
✅ Who you are professionally
✅ What you bring to the table
✅ Why they should care

🔹 Confidence is built before the interview
I used to overthink every answer, but preparation changed everything. Record yourself, practice with a friend, or even talk to yourself in the mirror (yes, I’ve done this). The more you practice, the less your nerves control you.

🔹 Ask smart questions because you’re also interviewing them.
At the end of the interview, don’t just sit there waiting to be dismissed.
Ask:
❓ “What are the biggest challenges in this role?”
❓ “How do you define success in the first 6 months?”
It shows confidence and makes them remember you.

At the end of the day, interviews are about impressing people with how well you fit the role.

Agree?


Happy Webnesday & stay safe ❤️
…more","How Long Does It Really Take to Prepare for an Interview? 

On average, job seekers spend 5 to 10 hours preparing for an interview. But here’s the kicker—it’s not just about logging hours; it’s about what you do with that time. Effective preparation can mean the difference between landing your dream job and walking away disappointed.

Here’s the good news: you can maximize your preparation time with a few targeted strategies.

3 Tips to Set Yourself Up for Success:

1) Do Your Homework: Research the company’s mission, values, and recent projects. Dive deep into the job description and connect the dots between what they need and what you bring to the table.

2) Practice Smart: Don’t wing it! Practice answering common interview questions, but don’t stop there. PRO-TIP: Record yourself, get feedback, and refine your responses to sound natural and confident.

3) Prepare to Connect: Beyond qualifications, interviewers want to see if you’re a cultural fit. Come prepared with thoughtful questions about the role, team, or company that show you’re genuinely interested and make impactful connections.

Remember, it’s not about rehearsing every word but about being prepared enough to feel confident and adaptable. With the right approach, those 5 to 10 hours can transform into an offer!

I recently interviewed someone, and it didn’t go as expected. When I asked, ""Tell us a bit about yourself,"" the response was a blunt ""No.""😳

I kept trying. We like to ask a mix of work-related and personal questions because getting to know someone personally is just as important as professionally. I asked, ""Have you been anywhere beautiful?"" Another ""No.""🤦‍♀️ Then I asked, ""Where are you from?"" and they said ""Mauritius!""🌴 One of the most beautiful places in the world!

Despite my best efforts, every answer was ""nothing"" or ""no.""😅

If you’re heading into an interview:
✨Be prepared to share about yourself - professionally and personally
✨Engage with the questions. Show us who you are
✨Let your personality shine - it’s just as important as your skills

An interview is your chance to make an impression - don’t let it pass you by! 💪

In my years as a Senior Executive in Business Intelligence, I’ve learned that technical skills alone don’t make a great data analyst—the ability to ask the right questions does.

Before diving into dashboards or reports, it’s crucial to understand:
🔹 What business problem are we solving?
🔹 Which insights will truly impact decision-making?
🔹 What KPIs matter most?

Skipping this step can lead to impressive-looking reports that don’t drive real impact. In my latest project, asking the right questions turned a basic sales dashboard into a powerful decision-making tool, helping the team track trends, segment performance, and take real-time action.

Even if you had a difficult experience at your previous job, a job interview is a short window where you need to highlight your value and 'sell yourself' as a professional, rather than focusing on past negativity.

✘ ""My previous manager was terrible""
Comes across as a complaint and raises concerns about your ability to work in a team.
Better way to say it: ""I value working in an environment with clear communication and strong leadership.""

✘ ""The company was a chaos""
This can come across as complaining rather than showing adaptability.
Better way to say it: ""I thrive in workplaces with structured processes and well-defined roles.""

✘ ""I wasn’t paid enough""
Focusing too much on salary might make it seem like that’s your only priority.
Better way to say it: ""I’m looking for a role where my skills and contributions are valued.""

✘ ""I’ll take any job""
Makes you sound desperate rather than motivated.
Better way to say it: ""I’m looking for a role where I can bring value and grow professionally.""

✘ ""I don’t want to work overtime""
Could give the impression that you're unwilling to take responsibility.
Better way to say it: ""I believe in maintaining a good work-life balance while delivering high-quality results.""


Interviews are about how you frame your experience and approach. Instead of focusing on what didn’t work in the past, highlight what you’re looking for in your next role and how you can contribute.

While companies are evaluating you for a role, don’t forget that you're also assessing whether the company is a good fit for you.

Here are a few questions to ask during your interview:

- About the role:
What will my day-to-day responsibilities look like?
How do success and performance get measured?
What would the average day look like for me, to be very successful in the position?

- About the culture:
How would you describe the team dynamic?
What’s the work-life balance like here?
Why are you hiring for this position?
Why did you last 2 staff members leave your agency?

- About growth opportunities:
What does career progression look like at this company?
Are there opportunities for development and advancement?
What are the long terms plans for the company?

An interview is a two-way conversation. Ensure you go into an interview with a good idea of what you are looking for from your next company. Make sure you leave with the clarity you need to make an informed decision about your next step.

Here are the top tips/ tricks I like to relay to candidates before they interview with one of my clients.

1. Do your research so you can speak to why you are interested in THIS company and THIS role. Review the company’s website. Look at the interviewer’s LI profile so you understand their background. Be prepared with examples of how your experience aligns with the bullet points on the job description.

2. Dress to impress. Dress to impress. Dress to impress. Our culture has gone quite casual since COVID, but I’d rather you be overdressed for the interview than underdressed. You can get casual once you’ve gotten the job.

3. Come prepared with a ton of questions. Yes, you will likely get the majority of those questions answered simply through the conversation, but it’s important to have questions prepared so at the end of the interview, when the interviewer asks you what questions you have, you have some!

4. You CAN have questions/ thoughts written out next to you (shocker!) An interview is not a test. Consulting your padfolio for questions or thoughts shows that you have done your prep for the interview, have invested the time and are truly interested.

5. If still interested in the opportunity as the interview wraps up, let the interviewer know at the end of the interview! I think a lot of candidates get superstitious and want to hold their excitement close to the vest. People hire people they like. And people like people who want to work with them! So if you are interested, let them know.

6. Send a thank you email by EOD. It’s noticeable if you don’t. Take the five minutes and send one.

7. An interview is as much for you as it is for the client. It’s totally okay to interview and conclude you aren’t interested in moving forward.

I send these, as well as additional tips and attachments, to every candidate that is interviewing for a job through me. If you’d be interested in a copy of my standard prep email, please let me know – just shoot me an email or comment here and I can get it in your inbox.

Happy interviewing!

I see this almost daily on here, but you’d be surprised how many people still don’t prep properly for their interviews.

I get it—you’ve been in the industry for years, you know your stuff, and you think you can wing it. But no matter how experienced or confident you feel, skipping interview prep is like turning up to a test without revising. You might pass, but why take the risk?

Tips I always give my candidates:

✅DO YOUR RESEARCH!!! – How are you turning up to a job interview knowing nothing about the company you could be working for? Check their website, LinkedIn, recent news, and even employee reviews if you can. Make sure you can confidently talk about why you want to work there.

✅ ALWAYS have questions to ask – It’s not just about them interviewing you; you’re also seeing if the role and company are the right fit for you. Ask things like: What do you enjoy about working here? What’s kept you here for so long? What’s the biggest challenge in this role?

✅ Know your CV inside out – If it’s on your CV, be ready to talk about it. If you listed a skill, have an example of how you’ve used it. If you put down responsibilities, be prepared to explain how you handled them.

✅ Dress appropriately – Sounds obvious, but first impressions count. Even if it’s a casual workplace, turning up looking scruffy isn’t a good look. If in doubt, always go smarter.

✅ Be yourself – They’re hiring a person, not just a skillset. Show your personality, be professional but natural, and remember that interviews are just conversations (with slightly higher stakes).

At the end of the day, preparation = confidence. Go in knowing you’ve done the work, and the rest will follow.

✅ Instead: ""I ensure my reports are accurate by validating data sources and cross-checking metrics before delivery.""

❌ Saying You Don’t Know Without Trying to Find a Solution
🔹 Saying: ""I’ve never used that tool, so I wouldn’t know.""
✅ Instead: ""I haven’t worked with that tool yet, but I’m a quick learner and have adapted to new technologies in the past.""

Rambling during an interview is a common issue that can affect your progress in the hiring process. The candidates who stand out are able to communicate their experiences and skills in a clear, concise, and engaging way.

Early in my career, I struggled with this too, whether it was in interviews, presentations, or networking. It’s easy to ramble when you’re nervous, or trying to fill silence. But over time, I learned a few key strategies that helped me keep my responses focused and impactful.

Here are some tips that helped me:

1. Practice Positive Affirmations

Before any interview or presentation, take a moment to remind yourself that you deserve this opportunity, that you're knowledgeable, and that you're ready. Positive affirmations help calm your nerves, reduce anxiety, and give you the confidence to express yourself clearly.

2. Slow Down Your Speech

It may sound counterintuitive, but slowing down your speaking pace can make a huge difference. When you talk too fast, it's easy to stumble over words or add unnecessary filler. Slowing down not only gives you time to think but also helps you sound more thoughtful and deliberate.

3. Record Yourself

Recording yourself can feel awkward, but it’s one of the most effective ways to improve. Listening to your responses will help you identify areas where you can refine your delivery. If listening to yourself feels uncomfortable, try practicing with a friend for feedback.

Try these tips next time you have an interview or a big presentation and remember this will take practice so don't be hard on yourself.

(And what TO say instead):

Incredible resource from my friend🔥
Check him out for more insights like this.

Interviews are like first dates,
Awkward and hard.

You only get 30 minutes to:

✅ See if you're a fit.
✅ Showcase your skills.
✅ Show your enthusiasm.

Don't fall into the trap of sending the wrong message.

Avoid saying these 10 things:
(And what to say instead)

1/ ""I don't have any questions.""
↳ Why: Shows zero preparation or interest
↳ Instead: Ask specific questions about the team's current projects or culture

2/ ""I'll take any job right now.""
↳ Why: Signals desperation, kills your negotiating power
↳ Instead: Highlight skills that match this specific role

3/ ""I don't like taking direction.""
↳ Why: Gives the impression you're uncoachable
↳ Instead: Share how you've grown from feedback

4/ ""I don't have any weaknesses.""
↳ Why: Sounds unrealistic and arrogant
↳ Instead: Share a real weakness and how you're improving

5/ ""I hate my current boss.""
↳ Why: Raises red flags about professionalism
↳ Instead: Focus on your career growth goals

6/ ""I'll figure it out as I go.""
↳ Why: Suggests you don't prepare
↳ Instead: Emphasize your (proven) ability to learn quickly

7/ ""This is a stepping stone for me.""
↳ Why: Companies don't want to invest in short-term employees
↳ Instead: Share your interest in growing with the company

8/ ""What's your work-from-home policy?"" (too early)
↳ Why: Makes work flexibility seem like your top priority
↳ Instead: First discuss role and fit and get them interested

9/ ""What time do people leave?""
↳ Why: Implies you're just watching the clock
↳ Instead: Ask about daily workflows and responsibilities

10/ ""I don't handle stress well.""
↳ Why: Suggests you'll struggle under pressure
↳ Instead: Describe how you organize work to manage deadlines

Remember:
Preparation and positivity go a long way.

NEVER USE PDFs FOR YOUR RESUME. Too easy for your prospective hiring manager to open. Make them work for it. Use a weird format like .BMP or .Tiff. This provides an air of mystery to your resume. ""What could this be? How the hell do I even open a TARGA file in 2025?"" Hiring managers love puzzle solving, so give them something they can really sink their teeth into.

START INTERVIEWS BY REVEALING A TRAGIC FAMILY SECRET: You can make one up if you need to. ""My grandpa could have stopped Ted Bundy, but didn't"" is a good one. ""Every one of my uncles is a horse thief"" is more niche, but there's a timeless quality to it. My tip? Have fun with it.

INSIST ON BEING PAID IN RARE JEWELS: Inflation, shmilflation! Sure, it may take a few extra steps, but nothing spends better than a sack full of sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds. Slapping down a topaz at the local five and dime is a real flex.

FORCE YOUR INTERVIEWER TO TAKE A POSITION ON MARTIN LUTHER: Divinely inspired reformer, or blasphemous oaf? Both positions are respectable, but make them take a side, and more importantly, defend it.

END WITH A SONG: Most interviewers end interviews with ""Do you have any more questions?"" This is when you queue up some music and say, ""Just one: do you enjoy Billy Joel's middle period?"" That's when you can delight them with a rendition of ""Uptown Girl"" or ""Allentown."" Don't go for B-Sides like ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"" or ""Running on Ice"" you'll just be wasting everyone's time.

✅ Data Visualization That Tells a Story – Anyone can make charts. Can you make them speak? Power BI, Tableau, or Looker—whichever tool, the goal is clarity.
✅ Business & Product Thinking – Data isn’t just numbers. It’s a tool to solve business problems. Can you connect the dots?
✅ Cloud & ETL Basics – Snowflake, BigQuery, Alteryx, dbt—knowing how data flows matters. Even basic knowledge gives you an edge.
✅ Clear Communication – If you can explain a complex insight to someone with zero data background, you win.

⚠️ What to Avoid Saying:
❌ “I know everything.” – No one does. Not even AI. Stay humble, stay curious.
❌ “I can learn Python in a week.” – Learning never stops, but be realistic. Depth matters.
❌ “I love data.” – That’s great, but so does everyone applying. Show why it matters in your work.
❌ Buzzwords overload. – Fancy terms won’t help if your answers aren’t clear. Keep it simple, keep it sharp.

At the end of the day, they’re not just hiring skills. They’re hiring mindset, problem-solving, and adaptability.
Go in with clarity. Stay confident. And most importantly be yourself.

When they ask, “𝐷𝑜 𝑦𝑜𝑢 ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑞𝑢𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑢𝑠?”

Avoid saying, “𝑁𝑜, 𝐼’𝑚 𝑔𝑜𝑜𝑑!” That’s not confidence—it’s missed opportunity.

Instead, ask about team culture, growth opportunities, or what success looks like in the role. It shows you’re interested in more than just the paycheck (even if that’s the main reason 😉).

Remember: interviews go both ways. Impress them, but make sure they impress you too.

In the world of interviews, authenticity always wins.

Companies aren’t looking for candidates who sound like they’ve memorized complex jargon or faked a perfect accent.

They want real, genuine individuals who are honest about their skills and ready to grow.

If your vocabulary feels limited or you make a mistake, don’t stress!

Employers value honesty and potential more than perfection.

It’s better to communicate clearly and logically using simple words rather than trying to impress with borrowed phrases.

Focus on what you can bring to the table and how you can contribute to their goals.

Remember, being genuine shows confidence, and that’s exactly what every company seeks.

Stay true to yourself, and don’t be afraid to share your story—flaws and all.

👉 Lack of preparation
Candidates often fail to research the company. Read up on their history, mission, and recent news. This shows genuine interest and can set you apart.

👉 Overlooking the job description
Make sure you understand the role requirements deeply. Highlight how your experience and skills align with what they need.

👉 Poor body language
Slouching, avoiding eye contact, or fidgeting can send negative signals. Practise confident, calm, and positive body language.

👉 Talking too much (or too little)
Aim for balanced responses. Be concise but provide enough detail to showcase your abilities. It's a conversation, not a monologue.

👉 Not asking questions
Show curiosity and engagement by asking insightful questions about the role and the company. It shows you're seriously considering the position.

👉 Ignoring cultural fit
Researching the company's culture can help you assess if you'd thrive there. Mention how your values align with theirs.

Remember, interviews are as much about fit as they are about skills. Be prepared, be yourself, and good luck!

Interview prep goes a long way. 

A quick Google search on a brand may be the deciding factor between you and another candidate.

For context, if I'm interviewing 2 candidates and one of them knows nothing about our brand and the other is familiar with our product line or knows a couple places where we sell our products......guess who's going to be the front runner? The person who did a quick search on what kind of company they were applying to.

Are you expected to be an expert? absolutely not!

But next time a recruiter or hiring manager asks ""How did you first hear about us"" or ""What stood out to you about this role compared to others"", you'll be prepared. Lasting impressions are built on confidence.

A Recruiter's Perspective... 👩‍💻 

Great interviews often end with the classic ""Do you have any questions for me/us?"" This is your opportunity to leave a lasting impression!

Asking thoughtful questions shows you're not only interested in the job, but you also want to ensure it's the right fit for both you and the company. A few ideas to come up with impactful questions, include researching the company and reviewing the job description.

Here are some ways to craft meaningful questions:

1. Research the Company:
Look up recent news about the company, its mission, and values. Review their website. Understand its culture and any growth or changes in operations. This will allow you to ask questions that reflect your understanding of the organization’s priorities and long-term vision.

2. Review the Job Description:
Analyze the key responsibilities and requirements listed in the job posting. Craft questions that clarify aspects of the role that are important to you, such as work schedule flexibility, team dynamics, or the company’s approach to training and development.

3. Align with Your Interests:
Think about what matters most to you in a job; whether it’s career growth, work-life balance, or safety initiatives. Tailor your questions to focus on how the company supports those values, and how you can contribute in a way that aligns with your strengths.

By asking insightful questions based on your research, you’ll show that you’re not just looking for any job, but that you’re genuinely interested in being a valuable contributor to the team. Don’t hesitate to use this moment to clarify the company’s expectations and share what you’re seeking in a role.

Pro-Tip: Working with a coach on interview prep can assist with developing effective questions as well. 👍

The misconceptions around the Data Analyst role often downplay the technical expertise and problem-solving skills required. From my experience, being a successful Data Analyst goes beyond creating dashboards or reports. It’s about asking the right questions, understanding the business context, and applying technical skills to uncover actionable insights.

For me, the key skills have been:

Proficiency in tools like SQL, Python and data visualization platforms like Tableau or Power BI.
A solid understanding of data cleaning and wrangling, as raw data is rarely perfect.
The ability to work with cross-functional teams to align on goals and translate business needs into analytical solutions.
Curious to hear your perspective on how aspiring Data Analysts can best prepare for the complexities of the role!

The biggest challenge in becoming a Data Analyst isn't just building technical expertise—it's how you present yourself in your resume and profile to escape the trap of monotonous rejection criteria. Many talented candidates are filtered out by rigid HR processes that rely on keyword matching rather than evaluating real potential.

As a recruiter, I frequently get asked about ways to set yourself apart and prepare for interviews. Here are some essential tips to help you shine:

1. Research the Company and the Role: Understand the company's mission, values, and culture, as well as the specific role you're applying for. This shows your genuine interest and helps you tailor your answers to align with the company's goals. Dive into their website, read recent news articles, and check out their social media to get a sense of their current projects and initiatives.

2️. Practice Common Questions: Prepare answers for typical interview questions. Think about your experiences and how they relate to the role.

3. Dress the Part: First impressions matter! Choose an outfit that reflects professionalism.

4️. Ask Questions: Interviews are a two-way street. Prepare thoughtful questions to ask your interviewer. This demonstrates your interest in the role and helps you assess if the company is the right fit for you.

5️. Follow Up: Send a thank-you email after the interview to express your appreciation. It sets you apart!

One crucial aspect of interview preparation is knowing how to answer common interview questions effectively. Check out this article from The Muse for valuable insights on how to tackle those tricky questions:

…more","Two people applied for the same computational biologist job last year. They both also happened to share their resume with me for feedback. One of them (A) did NOT get an interview. The other one (B) did. What made the difference?

The job description (JD) specifically asked for the following experience (among many others):
- Lead efforts to expand the immune cell atlas by incorporating single-cell RNA-seq data from various tissues.
- Refine cell type annotations to increase the granularity of the atlas, improving the ability to distinguish subtle differences between immune cell subsets across tissues.

A’s resume says:
- Conducted single-cell and bulk RNA seq analysis on tumor and adjacent normal tissues to identify inflammatory cells driving racial disparities in lung cancer.
- Utilized single-cell gene signatures to deconvolute the bulk data for improved risk assessment and targeted treatment strategies in high-risk minority populations.

B’s resume says:
- Grew internal single-cell RNA-seq database to 17M+ cells spanning 200+ studies. Improved metadata by adding standardized disease ontologies, cell-level annotations, clearer treatment history, and TCR/BCR clonotype information.
- Created a single-cell RNA-seq reference atlas with dozens of tumor indications with scVI. Used the atlas to automate cell type annotation of new single-cell RNA-seq data with scANVI.

See the difference? A and B both have relevant experience with the tasks that the JD asked for, but B’s experience was just that much more relevant and specific than A’s.

In reviewing my back-and-forth messages with A, one phrase I kept using is “immediately apparent”.

“It is not immediately apparent that you have put together large single-cell atlases from distinct sources and standardized cell type annotations, even though you have worked with scRNA-seq data.”

B's resume, on the other hand, made it immediately apparent that they should get the interview.

Hopefully this helps people see just how much hiring managers for computational biology roles care about exact fit in this job market.

B actually ended up getting the job and started a few weeks ago.

…more","This is probably one of the biggest mistakes I see from Aspiring Data Analysts

They’ll jump into fancy dashboards, complex queries, and advanced models—yet skip the simplest (but most important) step: understanding the data’s context.

I learned this the hard way.

One of my very first projects involved analyzing customer churn. I spent a week building SQL queries and cool visualizations. But when I presented the findings, the manager pointed out a glaring gap: I didn’t even consider the industry’s unique sales cycle. Half of my recommendations were useless because I never bothered to learn the business side.

The lesson?

Even a perfect query can have wrong insights if you don’t know your domain.

Don’t just analyze rows and columns in a vacuum—ask about the story behind the data, the business process that produces it, and the real-life implications of your numbers.

I see a lot of analysts focusing on what the data looks like, rather than why it looks that way. They collect KPIs without fully grasping how they tie back to actual challenges in marketing, finance, or ops.

Sure, mastering technical skills is crucial. But if you’re not linking your analysis to real-world context, you'll NEVER truly understand the business

So here’s my question for YOU: Which approach has made the biggest difference in your career—knowing every function and formula, or deeply understanding the business behind the data?

I know which changed my results. What about you?

There is nothing wrong with not being too personal and just state that you are hard working, love working with people, really working on complicated projects.

There is also a failure on the other side, why can they not lead the conversation and be a bit more warm instead of feeling like you are on trial.

I like to ask questions and get a better understanding of someone, I just want to see some passion and excitement so I feel they are someone thats human and relatable also I find that asking people questions about stuff they are passionate about just helps move the interview forward instead of being really nervy

Focus on getting referrals, instead of applying to jobs.

So how do you get referrals?

By networking strategically.

Follow these steps:

1. after applying for the job, go to the companies linkedin page
2. click on people tab
3. linkedin sorts the people by connections, so click the first profile that interests you
4. skim their profile and note if you have any shared interests (does not have to data related). Optionally: if they are active on linkedin, engage with their content.
5. craft a cold message that shows you know something about them and that you are interested in learning more about a shared interest
6. repeat this process for 5-10 people at the company

𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲:
- expect a 5-10% response rate
- if they dont respond, follow up after 2 and 7 days
- focus on setting up a informational interview and asking for the referral at the very end of that chat
- if you have very low amount of connections (<300) this will not work well (help on this will be in the comments)

In today’s world, data is everywhere. Every click, purchase, and interaction generates valuable insights. But raw data alone isn’t useful—that’s where data analytics comes in.

So, what is data analytics?

At its core, data analytics is the process of examining data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that help businesses make better decisions.

There are four main types:

1. Descriptive Analytics - What happened? (e.g., Sales increased by 10% last quarter)
2. Diagnostic Analytics - Why did it happen? (e.g., Sales increased due to a new marketing campaign)
3. Predictive Analytics - What might happen next? (e.g., Sales are expected to rise again next quarter)
4. Prescriptive Analytics - What should we do about it? (e.g., Increase ad spend to maximize future sales)

Why does this matter?

Businesses use data analytics to improve efficiency, reduce costs, enhance customer experience, and drive growth. From Netflix recommendations to fraud detection in banking, data analytics is shaping the world around us.

Interview nerves are super common. 93% of Americans feel stressed before an interview. Trying to make a good first impression while answering important questions is a lot to juggle.

Here are a few tips to help calm those pre-interview jitters:

🔎 Research
↳ Preparation is a great way to calm your nerves. The more you know about the company and role, the more confident you'll feel.

✍️ Prepare Notes
↳ Before your interview, print out your resume and job description to have as a quick reference. Jot down a few key points about the role, your experience, and your questions.

💬 Mock Interviews with Friends
↳ The more you practice, the easier it gets! Doing mock interviews helps take the edge off and gives you a chance to rehearse your answers.

🧘‍♀️ Take a few deep breaths
↳ Calm down by taking some mindful breaths. Try the 4-7-8 technique to center yourself.

💙 Say Affirmations
↳ Positive affirmations work wonders for boosting your confidence and calming your nerves. Remind yourself of your value and abilities!

🗣️ Speak Slowly
↳ During the interview, speaking slowly will give you time to collect your thoughts. If you begin to feel anxious, pause and take a breath.

🌠 Don't Strive for Perfection
↳ An interview is just a conversation! Trying to be perfect will only make you overthink. Focus on connecting with the interviewer instead.

Remember: It's completely normal to feel nervous! Your interviewer wants you to succeed. Trust in yourself - you’ve got this. 💪🌟

Her SQL skills, data visualization samples, and architecture and design knowledge were excellent.

But her resume had a 3-year gap.

When I asked if she had any questions in the final interview, she said something that hit me:

""I'm surprised you didn't drill me about my employment gap. Every other company has.""

One of my mentor once told me:

'Life is messy. What matters is who you are today and where you're going.'

That manager took a chance on me when I lacked the skill, and I became his most successful hire that year.

Three months in, she's already leading our customer analytics overhaul.

Here’s what I’ve learned:
→ Non-traditional paths build exceptional talent.
→ Perfect resumes don’t tell the whole story.

Behind every successful business strategy is a data analyst who uncovered the insights to make it possible. Here’s why I believe data analysts are modern problem solvers:
We Simplify Complexity: We take overwhelming datasets and extract meaningful patterns.
We Enable Strategic Decisions: Our insights guide leadership teams in making informed choices.
We Drive Innovation: From customer personalization to operational optimization, we turn possibilities into realities.
💡 Example from My Experience:
While analyzing operational data for a logistics firm, I identified inefficiencies in delivery routes. By proposing optimized routes, we reduced costs by 20%—a game-changer for the business.
Reflection:
As data analysts, we’re not just number crunchers. We’re change-makers. What’s a problem you’ve solved using data? Let’s celebrate these wins together!

If something looks wrong, say it.

You spend 10+ hours preparing for interviews.
You research, rehearse, and refine your answers.

But then… a generic rejection email.
No feedback. No insights. No next steps. Just silence.

Here’s how to break the cycle and take back control. 👇

At the end of your interview, ask this one powerful question:

💡 ""Is there anything about my resume or interview that makes you doubt I’d be a good fit for this role?""

Why? Because 70%+ of hiring managers have concerns they never voice. 🚨

🔹 This question forces them to reveal any red flags
🔹 It gives you real-time feedback on where you stand
🔹 You get a chance to clarify misunderstandings immediately

Instead of waiting weeks for a rejection, you get instant insights.

🚀 Pro Tip: If they mention a concern, don’t panic! Instead, respond with:

✅ ""That’s a great point! Let me clarify...""
✅ ""I actually have experience with that—let me explain...""
✅ ""I’d love to share an example to address that...""

💡 When you handle objections live, you increase your hiring chances by 40%+.

Next time, don’t just hope for an offer—ask for the feedback that can get you there. 💼🔥

…more","Data analysis is the process of gleaning insights from data to inform better business decisions. Analyzing data typically moves through five iterative phases:

•Identify the data you want to analyze
•Collect the data
•Clean the data in preparation for analysis
•Analyze the data
•Interpret the results of the analysis


👉Data Analyst Tasks and Responsibilities:

A data analyst is a person who gathers and interprets data to solve a specific problem. The role includes plenty of time spent with data but entails communicating findings too.

Here’s what many data analysts do on a day-to-day basis:

1️⃣ Gather data: Analysts often collect data themselves. This could include conducting surveys, tracking visitor characteristics on a company website, or buying data sets from data collection specialists.

2️⃣ Clean data: Raw data might contain duplicates, errors, or outliers. Cleaning the data means maintaining the data quality in a spreadsheet or through a programming language so that your interpretations won’t be wrong or skewed.

3️⃣ Model data: This entails creating and designing the structures of a database. You might choose what data types to store and collect, establish how data categories are related, and work through how the data appears.

4️⃣ Interpret data: Interpreting data will involve finding patterns or trends in data that can help you answer the question at hand.

5️⃣ Present: Communicating the results of your findings will be a crucial part of your job. You create visualizations like charts and graphs, write reports, and present information to interested parties.


…more","Ever walked out of an interview thinking, 
“I could’ve answered that so much better” 🤔 ? 

Yeah, me too.

The truth is, most of us don’t fail interviews because we’re not good enough, we fail because we don’t know how to communicate our value the right way.

And I learned this the hard way.

Back when I first started preparing for interviews, I thought “just be yourself” was enough. But reality hit me fast. Interviews are a skill, and like any skill, you get better with practice.

One resource that helped me a lot was The Interview Guide School by Jason Kwok Yuan Long. I’ve had it for a long time. Here are some helpful tips you can take note of:

🔹 Stop “describing” your experience, start proving your impact.
Saying “I managed projects” isn’t enough.
Instead, say:
➡️ “I led a team of 5 to complete a project 2 weeks ahead of schedule, saving 20% in costs.”
Show the numbers, show the impact.

🔹 Nail the “Tell me about yourself” question.
This is NOT your autobiography.
Think of it as your 30-second personal brand pitch:
✅ Who you are professionally
✅ What you bring to the table
✅ Why they should care

🔹 Confidence is built before the interview
I used to overthink every answer, but preparation changed everything. Record yourself, practice with a friend, or even talk to yourself in the mirror (yes, I’ve done this). The more you practice, the less your nerves control you.

🔹 Ask smart questions because you’re also interviewing them.
At the end of the interview, don’t just sit there waiting to be dismissed.
Ask:
❓ “What are the biggest challenges in this role?”
❓ “How do you define success in the first 6 months?”
It shows confidence and makes them remember you.

At the end of the day, interviews are about impressing people with how well you fit the role.

Agree?


Happy Webnesday & stay safe ❤️
…more","How Long Does It Really Take to Prepare for an Interview? 

On average, job seekers spend 5 to 10 hours preparing for an interview. But here’s the kicker—it’s not just about logging hours; it’s about what you do with that time. Effective preparation can mean the difference between landing your dream job and walking away disappointed.

Here’s the good news: you can maximize your preparation time with a few targeted strategies.

3 Tips to Set Yourself Up for Success:

1) Do Your Homework: Research the company’s mission, values, and recent projects. Dive deep into the job description and connect the dots between what they need and what you bring to the table.

2) Practice Smart: Don’t wing it! Practice answering common interview questions, but don’t stop there. PRO-TIP: Record yourself, get feedback, and refine your responses to sound natural and confident.

3) Prepare to Connect: Beyond qualifications, interviewers want to see if you’re a cultural fit. Come prepared with thoughtful questions about the role, team, or company that show you’re genuinely interested and make impactful connections.

Remember, it’s not about rehearsing every word but about being prepared enough to feel confident and adaptable. With the right approach, those 5 to 10 hours can transform into an offer!

In my years as a Senior Executive in Business Intelligence, I’ve learned that technical skills alone don’t make a great data analyst—the ability to ask the right questions does.

Before diving into dashboards or reports, it’s crucial to understand:
🔹 What business problem are we solving?
🔹 Which insights will truly impact decision-making?
🔹 What KPIs matter most?

Skipping this step can lead to impressive-looking reports that don’t drive real impact. In my latest project, asking the right questions turned a basic sales dashboard into a powerful decision-making tool, helping the team track trends, segment performance, and take real-time action.

People often ask, ""What's the difference between a Data Analyst and a Business Analyst?"" Well, let’s break it down:

🔹 Data Analysts are the detectives of numbers—they dig deep, uncover patterns, and make datasets speak using SQL, Python, and visualization tools.

🔹 Business Analysts are the strategists—they take those insights, align them with business goals, and present them with compelling reports and PowerPoint decks.

But here’s the real twist—both roles thrive on data! Whether it's financial trends, healthcare stats, or customer behavior, data analysis is the common thread.

You need to start networking more and applying less. That means being on linkedin everyday, engaging, connecting, and building relationships. That is how you stand out in todays job market. I linked to a couple posts in the comments that help you do this effectively.

𝗕𝗲 𝗘𝗮𝗿𝗹𝘆. I once applied to the same entry level job as a colleague who had way more experience than I did, but I got the interview because I applied within 24 hours of the job posting (I was using the Filter “Date posted” = Past 24 hours).

So, find messy data or create your own and build a project around it. Post about your mistakes, learnings, and milestones with the project. It’s not easy. It will take you days to even gather the data. I linked a post in the comments on how to did this.

One common trait they both share is their reliance on facts, details and numbers to make decisions.

In the same way, a data analyst should take cognisance of minor details. Every bit in visualization and interpretation helps. It could be the Axis title in a spreadsheet, or the difference between a string and an integer in a line of code

Even if you had a difficult experience at your previous job, a job interview is a short window where you need to highlight your value and 'sell yourself' as a professional, rather than focusing on past negativity.

✘ ""My previous manager was terrible""
Comes across as a complaint and raises concerns about your ability to work in a team.
Better way to say it: ""I value working in an environment with clear communication and strong leadership.""

✘ ""The company was a chaos""
This can come across as complaining rather than showing adaptability.
Better way to say it: ""I thrive in workplaces with structured processes and well-defined roles.""

✘ ""I wasn’t paid enough""
Focusing too much on salary might make it seem like that’s your only priority.
Better way to say it: ""I’m looking for a role where my skills and contributions are valued.""

✘ ""I’ll take any job""
Makes you sound desperate rather than motivated.
Better way to say it: ""I’m looking for a role where I can bring value and grow professionally.""

✘ ""I don’t want to work overtime""
Could give the impression that you're unwilling to take responsibility.
Better way to say it: ""I believe in maintaining a good work-life balance while delivering high-quality results.""

Here are the top tips/ tricks I like to relay to candidates before they interview with one of my clients.

1. Do your research so you can speak to why you are interested in THIS company and THIS role. Review the company’s website. Look at the interviewer’s LI profile so you understand their background. Be prepared with examples of how your experience aligns with the bullet points on the job description.

2. Dress to impress. Dress to impress. Dress to impress. Our culture has gone quite casual since COVID, but I’d rather you be overdressed for the interview than underdressed. You can get casual once you’ve gotten the job.

3. Come prepared with a ton of questions. Yes, you will likely get the majority of those questions answered simply through the conversation, but it’s important to have questions prepared so at the end of the interview, when the interviewer asks you what questions you have, you have some!

4. You CAN have questions/ thoughts written out next to you (shocker!) An interview is not a test. Consulting your padfolio for questions or thoughts shows that you have done your prep for the interview, have invested the time and are truly interested.

5. If still interested in the opportunity as the interview wraps up, let the interviewer know at the end of the interview! I think a lot of candidates get superstitious and want to hold their excitement close to the vest. People hire people they like. And people like people who want to work with them! So if you are interested, let them know.

6. Send a thank you email by EOD. It’s noticeable if you don’t. Take the five minutes and send one.

7. An interview is as much for you as it is for the client. It’s totally okay to interview and conclude you aren’t interested in moving forward.

I send these, as well as additional tips and attachments, to every candidate that is interviewing for a job through me. If you’d be interested in a copy of my standard prep email, please let me know – just shoot me an email or comment here and I can get it in your inbox.

Happy interviewing!

I see this almost daily on here, but you’d be surprised how many people still don’t prep properly for their interviews.

I get it—you’ve been in the industry for years, you know your stuff, and you think you can wing it. But no matter how experienced or confident you feel, skipping interview prep is like turning up to a test without revising. You might pass, but why take the risk?

Tips I always give my candidates:

✅DO YOUR RESEARCH!!! – How are you turning up to a job interview knowing nothing about the company you could be working for? Check their website, LinkedIn, recent news, and even employee reviews if you can. Make sure you can confidently talk about why you want to work there.

✅ ALWAYS have questions to ask – It’s not just about them interviewing you; you’re also seeing if the role and company are the right fit for you. Ask things like: What do you enjoy about working here? What’s kept you here for so long? What’s the biggest challenge in this role?

✅ Know your CV inside out – If it’s on your CV, be ready to talk about it. If you listed a skill, have an example of how you’ve used it. If you put down responsibilities, be prepared to explain how you handled them.

✅ Dress appropriately – Sounds obvious, but first impressions count. Even if it’s a casual workplace, turning up looking scruffy isn’t a good look. If in doubt, always go smarter.

✅ Be yourself – They’re hiring a person, not just a skillset. Show your personality, be professional but natural, and remember that interviews are just conversations (with slightly higher stakes).

At the end of the day, preparation = confidence. Go in knowing you’ve done the work, and the rest will follow.

One of the biggest myths is that data analysis is a non-technical role. Additionally, it is not solely about creating dashboards.

Data analysis involves:

- Solving problems using data
- Extracting meaningful insights from data
- Assisting in business decision-making
- And, importantly, being technically proficient to accomplish the above tasks.

Interviews are not just about showcasing your technical skills, they're also about demonstrating professionalism and cultural fit.

Here are a few things you should avoid saying in a Data Analyst interview:

❌ Speaking Negatively About a Previous Employer
🔹 Saying: ""My last company had a terrible work culture.""
✅ Instead: ""I’m looking for an environment where I can grow and take on more analytical challenges.""

❌ Blaming Your Manager or Team
🔹 Saying: ""My manager didn’t know what they were doing.""
✅ Instead: ""I worked in a structured team but always sought opportunities to bring in new ideas and efficiencies.""

❌ Saying You Don’t Like Data Cleaning
🔹 Saying: ""I don’t enjoy data cleaning—it’s boring.""
✅ Instead: ""I understand data cleaning is crucial for quality insights, and I’ve developed efficient techniques to streamline the process.""

❌ Not Taking Responsibility for Mistakes
🔹 Saying: ""It wasn’t my fault that the dashboard was inaccurate.""
✅ Instead: ""I ensure my reports are accurate by validating data sources and cross-checking metrics before delivery.""

❌ Saying You Don’t Know Without Trying to Find a Solution
🔹 Saying: ""I’ve never used that tool, so I wouldn’t know.""
✅ Instead: ""I haven’t worked with that tool yet, but I’m a quick learner and have adapted to new technologies in the past.""

Your words shape the impression you leave! Focus on being positive, professional and growth oriented. 💡
…more","4 days lasted the previous Data Analyst…

That is what my last Operations Director client told me…

He hired a Data Analyst to manage all the reporting from his area, the fact was that there was plenty of work but not sexy work.

The result? He lasted only 4 days…

Now Imagine how much wasted time, between hiring, onboarding and back to hiring again, not talking the money involved...

Many companies face this same issue, they hire a Data Analyst by selling a super sexy position, when in reality they just have a glorified report maker.

Nothing wrong with being a report maker, that is part of my business, but everything wrong with selling a job for more interesting than it is.

But the same the other way around, you should ask before you join what the exact job will be, as it is also your responsibility to know what you want or not.

The solution, now they work with Blue Fado, where they get unlimited reporting developments and the expectations are clear.

Understanding Joins in Power BI & Data Analysis Interviews is very important 

When appearing for a Power BI or Data Analyst interview, you will likely face questions about Joins, as they are essential for combining data from multiple tables.

Joins are used to retrieve related data from different tables based on a common key.

Understanding their types and applications is crucial for working with Power BI, SQL, and other data tools.

Rambling during an interview is a common issue that can affect your progress in the hiring process. The candidates who stand out are able to communicate their experiences and skills in a clear, concise, and engaging way.

Early in my career, I struggled with this too, whether it was in interviews, presentations, or networking. It’s easy to ramble when you’re nervous, or trying to fill silence. But over time, I learned a few key strategies that helped me keep my responses focused and impactful.

Here are some tips that helped me:

1. Practice Positive Affirmations

Before any interview or presentation, take a moment to remind yourself that you deserve this opportunity, that you're knowledgeable, and that you're ready. Positive affirmations help calm your nerves, reduce anxiety, and give you the confidence to express yourself clearly.

2. Slow Down Your Speech

It may sound counterintuitive, but slowing down your speaking pace can make a huge difference. When you talk too fast, it's easy to stumble over words or add unnecessary filler. Slowing down not only gives you time to think but also helps you sound more thoughtful and deliberate.

3. Record Yourself

Recording yourself can feel awkward, but it’s one of the most effective ways to improve. Listening to your responses will help you identify areas where you can refine your delivery. If listening to yourself feels uncomfortable, try practicing with a friend for feedback.

Try these tips next time you have an interview or a big presentation and remember this will take practice so don't be hard on yourself.

(And what TO say instead):

Incredible resource from my friend🔥
Check him out for more insights like this.

Interviews are like first dates,
Awkward and hard.

You only get 30 minutes to:

✅ See if you're a fit.
✅ Showcase your skills.
✅ Show your enthusiasm.

Don't fall into the trap of sending the wrong message.

Avoid saying these 10 things:
(And what to say instead)

1/ ""I don't have any questions.""
↳ Why: Shows zero preparation or interest
↳ Instead: Ask specific questions about the team's current projects or culture

2/ ""I'll take any job right now.""
↳ Why: Signals desperation, kills your negotiating power
↳ Instead: Highlight skills that match this specific role

3/ ""I don't like taking direction.""
↳ Why: Gives the impression you're uncoachable
↳ Instead: Share how you've grown from feedback

4/ ""I don't have any weaknesses.""
↳ Why: Sounds unrealistic and arrogant
↳ Instead: Share a real weakness and how you're improving

5/ ""I hate my current boss.""
↳ Why: Raises red flags about professionalism
↳ Instead: Focus on your career growth goals

6/ ""I'll figure it out as I go.""
↳ Why: Suggests you don't prepare
↳ Instead: Emphasize your (proven) ability to learn quickly

7/ ""This is a stepping stone for me.""
↳ Why: Companies don't want to invest in short-term employees
↳ Instead: Share your interest in growing with the company

8/ ""What's your work-from-home policy?"" (too early)
↳ Why: Makes work flexibility seem like your top priority
↳ Instead: First discuss role and fit and get them interested

9/ ""What time do people leave?""
↳ Why: Implies you're just watching the clock
↳ Instead: Ask about daily workflows and responsibilities

10/ ""I don't handle stress well.""
↳ Why: Suggests you'll struggle under pressure
↳ Instead: Describe how you organize work to manage deadlines

Remember:
Preparation and positivity go a long way.

NEVER USE PDFs FOR YOUR RESUME. Too easy for your prospective hiring manager to open. Make them work for it. Use a weird format like .BMP or .Tiff. This provides an air of mystery to your resume. ""What could this be? How the hell do I even open a TARGA file in 2025?"" Hiring managers love puzzle solving, so give them something they can really sink their teeth into.

START INTERVIEWS BY REVEALING A TRAGIC FAMILY SECRET: You can make one up if you need to. ""My grandpa could have stopped Ted Bundy, but didn't"" is a good one. ""Every one of my uncles is a horse thief"" is more niche, but there's a timeless quality to it. My tip? Have fun with it.

INSIST ON BEING PAID IN RARE JEWELS: Inflation, shmilflation! Sure, it may take a few extra steps, but nothing spends better than a sack full of sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds. Slapping down a topaz at the local five and dime is a real flex.

FORCE YOUR INTERVIEWER TO TAKE A POSITION ON MARTIN LUTHER: Divinely inspired reformer, or blasphemous oaf? Both positions are respectable, but make them take a side, and more importantly, defend it.

END WITH A SONG: Most interviewers end interviews with ""Do you have any more questions?"" This is when you queue up some music and say, ""Just one: do you enjoy Billy Joel's middle period?"" That's when you can delight them with a rendition of ""Uptown Girl"" or ""Allentown."" Don't go for B-Sides like ""Big Man on Mulberry Street"" or ""Running on Ice"" you'll just be wasting everyone's time.

Myth 2: Interviewers care more about the tools you used
Reality: Tools are nice, but your thought process—‘Why this metric? Why does it matter?’—is what interviewers really want to see.

Myth 3: Interviews are looking for a degree in Data Science

Your first Data Analyst interview is here. You’re excited. Maybe a little nervous. That’s normal.
But beyond just knowing SQL, Python, and dashboards, what you say (and don’t say) can shape the outcome.

💡 What to Focus On:
✅ SQL That Works in the Real World – Writing queries is one thing. Writing efficient queries? That’s where the magic is. Window functions, CTEs, query optimization these matter.
✅ Data Visualization That Tells a Story – Anyone can make charts. Can you make them speak? Power BI, Tableau, or Looker—whichever tool, the goal is clarity.
✅ Business & Product Thinking – Data isn’t just numbers. It’s a tool to solve business problems. Can you connect the dots?
✅ Cloud & ETL Basics – Snowflake, BigQuery, Alteryx, dbt—knowing how data flows matters. Even basic knowledge gives you an edge.
✅ Clear Communication – If you can explain a complex insight to someone with zero data background, you win.

⚠️ What to Avoid Saying:
❌ “I know everything.” – No one does. Not even AI. Stay humble, stay curious.
❌ “I can learn Python in a week.” – Learning never stops, but be realistic. Depth matters.
❌ “I love data.” – That’s great, but so does everyone applying. Show why it matters in your work.
❌ Buzzwords overload. – Fancy terms won’t help if your answers aren’t clear. Keep it simple, keep it sharp.

At the end of the day, they’re not just hiring skills. They’re hiring mindset, problem-solving, and adaptability.
Go in with clarity. Stay confident. And most importantly be yourself.

 The class started with our tutor giving us a process to analyze

Step 1: Ask (defining the problem and business objective). This looks at the problems you are trying
to solve, specific answer to that question, the data available for that question and the expected outcome.

4) Python
(Or R, if you prefer.) But Python’s universal—so practice basic syntax, data manipulation (pandas), and some visualization libraries (matplotlib, seaborn).

Tableau, Power BI, Looker—pick one. Being able to design a dashboard and visualize insights is key.

6) Cloud Tools
AWS, Azure, or GCP can help you apply your data skills in the cloud. Great for people who want to stand out, but not a must-have for everyone right away.

7) Build a Stakeholder-Focused Portfolio
Don’t just do random projects—solve real (or realistic) business problems. Show you can speak the language of decision-makers and MAKE an impact.

8) Showcase & Network
Share your projects on LinkedIn, connect with peers, join data meetups. People hire people they know and trust.

👉 Lack of preparation
Candidates often fail to research the company. Read up on their history, mission, and recent news. This shows genuine interest and can set you apart.

👉 Overlooking the job description
Make sure you understand the role requirements deeply. Highlight how your experience and skills align with what they need.

👉 Poor body language
Slouching, avoiding eye contact, or fidgeting can send negative signals. Practise confident, calm, and positive body language.

👉 Talking too much (or too little)
Aim for balanced responses. Be concise but provide enough detail to showcase your abilities. It's a conversation, not a monologue.

👉 Not asking questions
Show curiosity and engagement by asking insightful questions about the role and the company. It shows you're seriously considering the position.

👉 Ignoring cultural fit
Researching the company's culture can help you assess if you'd thrive there. Mention how your values align with theirs.

Remember, interviews are as much about fit as they are about skills. Be prepared, be yourself, and good luck!

Before I begin any data analysis project, 
there is a crucial step I follow religiously -which is understanding the who, what, and how of the report. This initial phase sets the foundation for crafting a compelling narrative that resonates with the audience and drives impactful decision-making.

The Who: Understanding the audience who will be viewing the report is paramount. Whether it's executives, stakeholders, or customers, knowing who will be interpreting the data allows me to tailor the insights to meet their specific needs and expectations. Understanding the audience helps me in presenting the data in a way that is relevant and meaningful to them.

What: Defining the key objectives of the analysis is essential. What are the key questions we need to answer? What insights are we trying to uncover? Clearly defining these objectives guides the analysis and ensures that the report focuses on the most important information.

How: Determining the best way to communicate the findings is key. Will a presentation, dashboard, or written report be most effective? What visualizations will best convey the key messages?

By carefully considering these factors, I can ensure that the data analysis is not just about crunching numbers, but about effectively communicating valuable insights that drive informed decision-making.

As a data analyst, I tell stories with data and help businesses make informed decisions. By understanding the ""who, what, and how"" of each project, I can transform raw data into actionable insights that empower businesses to achieve their goals.

This is your chance to make an impact.

So beyond the obvious here are 5 INTERVIEW PREPARATION TIPS

1. Treat the interview as a BUSINESS MEETING - so plenty of preparation on the company and interviewers.
2. Don't have a cosy chat. Prepare objectives. Decide on the 4 or 5 things you can offer the employer and prepare tangible examples of each.
3. Decide on the 4 or 5 things you want to discover and prepare your questions. This could be more about the role, culture, people, way of working, future plans.
4. Be ready at the start. First impressions are key - so be prepared at least 5 minutes before the interview starts.
5. Prepare your closing statement. What are you going to say if you are positive about the interview and want to progress?

Interview prep goes a long way. 

A quick Google search on a brand may be the deciding factor between you and another candidate.

For context, if I'm interviewing 2 candidates and one of them knows nothing about our brand and the other is familiar with our product line or knows a couple places where we sell our products......guess who's going to be the front runner? The person who did a quick search on what kind of company they were applying to.

A Recruiter's Perspective... 👩‍💻 

Great interviews often end with the classic ""Do you have any questions for me/us?"" This is your opportunity to leave a lasting impression!

Asking thoughtful questions shows you're not only interested in the job, but you also want to ensure it's the right fit for both you and the company. A few ideas to come up with impactful questions, include researching the company and reviewing the job description.

Here are some ways to craft meaningful questions:

1. Research the Company:
Look up recent news about the company, its mission, and values. Review their website. Understand its culture and any growth or changes in operations. This will allow you to ask questions that reflect your understanding of the organization’s priorities and long-term vision.

2. Review the Job Description:
Analyze the key responsibilities and requirements listed in the job posting. Craft questions that clarify aspects of the role that are important to you, such as work schedule flexibility, team dynamics, or the company’s approach to training and development.

3. Align with Your Interests:
Think about what matters most to you in a job; whether it’s career growth, work-life balance, or safety initiatives. Tailor your questions to focus on how the company supports those values, and how you can contribute in a way that aligns with your strengths.

By asking insightful questions based on your research, you’ll show that you’re not just looking for any job, but that you’re genuinely interested in being a valuable contributor to the team. Don’t hesitate to use this moment to clarify the company’s expectations and share what you’re seeking in a role.

Pro-Tip: Working with a coach on interview prep can assist with developing effective questions as well. 👍

It’s about asking the right questions, understanding the business context, and applying technical skills to uncover actionable insights.

For me, the key skills have been:

Proficiency in tools like SQL, Python and data visualization platforms like Tableau or Power BI.
A solid understanding of data cleaning and wrangling, as raw data is rarely perfect.
The ability to work with cross-functional teams to align on goals and translate business needs into analytical solutions.
Curious to hear your perspective on how aspiring Data Analysts can best prepare for the complexities of the role!

The biggest challenge in becoming a Data Analyst isn't just building technical expertise—it's how you present yourself in your resume and profile to escape the trap of monotonous rejection criteria. Many talented candidates are filtered out by rigid HR processes that rely on keyword matching rather than evaluating real potential.

Call the interviewer by their first name. 


“𝑯𝒊 𝑳𝒊𝒔𝒂. 𝑻𝒐𝒏𝒚 𝑻𝒆𝒔𝒉𝒂𝒓𝒂. 𝑰’𝒎 𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚 𝒍𝒐𝒐𝒌𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒘𝒂𝒓𝒅 𝒕𝒐 𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒔𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒕𝒐𝒅𝒂𝒚.”

This tactic works for a variety of reasons:

✅ Creates an immediate position of equality. It
shows you value yourself on the same level.

✅ Calling it a conversation and not an interview.
You present yourself as relaxed. Calm. Ready.

✅ Makes you memorable. People will remember
The person who was bold enough to look
Them in the eye and call them their name.

It’s great to be confident and not arrogant.

Reminding yourself you belong in the interview for a reason should go a long way to prepare to be the best version of yourself. 💪

Data analysis isn’t just about creating aesthetically pleasing dashboards, it’s about solving real problems. This became clear as we kicked off the Data Analytics course with. By considering a theoretical case of an online retail store with Declining ratings, I got a hands-on walkthrough of the workflow of an analyst in any industry setting. Here are my key takeaways;

Understanding Customer Satisfaction in Online Retail Stores

To analyze customer satisfaction in an online retail store, we need to break down the process into manageable steps.

Step 1: Define the Problem and Business Objective

We begin by defining the problem we want to solve and identifying our business objective. In this case, the problem is 'Declining Ratings' and our goal is to analyze customer feedback and satisfaction ratings to pinpoint key pain points affecting customer experience and provide actionable recommendations for improvement.

Step 2: Identify Key Questions and Available Data

Next, we determine the specific questions we want to ask and assess what data is available to help answer them e.g what are the major complaints from customers, is customer satisfaction lower in some product categories, are there patterns in negative feedback like late delivery, poor product quality, etc.

Step 3: Gather and Prepare the Data

We gather relevant data from various sources (customer review datasets, customer log complaints, order delivery data, return/refund data). We extract data using techniques such as:

Extracting structured data using SQL
Collecting unstructured data through web scraping or API integrations from website. Then we combine all datasets into a centralized repository (e.g., Excel or CSV)

Step 4: Clean data

By dropping columns with excessive missing values (e.g., 80%)
Using imputation methods to replace missing values
Removing duplicates and standardizing text formats

Step 5: Analyze the Data

With our data in hand, we employ various analytical techniques to uncover insights and patterns, including:

Descriptive statistics to summarize trends
Correlation analysis to identify relationships between factors
Sentiment analysis to understand customer emotions in reviews

Step 6: Visualize the Findings

We communicate our findings through compelling visualizations, using:

Bar charts to illustrate complaints by product category
Line graphs to track customer satisfaction over time

Step 7: Communicate Insights and Recommendations

Finally, we present a summary of our findings and provide actionable recommendations to stakeholders, using:

PowerPoint or Google Slides presentations
Interactive dashboards in Power BI or Tableau
Summary reports in PDF or Word format, highlighting key takeaways

2. Finding Patterns & Telling Stories: Data doesn’t speak for itself. It’s our job to connect the dots, uncover trends, and translate raw numbers into meaningful insights that help businesses make better decisions.

…more","Two people applied for the same computational biologist job last year. They both also happened to share their resume with me for feedback. One of them (A) did NOT get an interview. The other one (B) did. What made the difference?

The job description (JD) specifically asked for the following experience (among many others):
- Lead efforts to expand the immune cell atlas by incorporating single-cell RNA-seq data from various tissues.
- Refine cell type annotations to increase the granularity of the atlas, improving the ability to distinguish subtle differences between immune cell subsets across tissues.

A’s resume says:
- Conducted single-cell and bulk RNA seq analysis on tumor and adjacent normal tissues to identify inflammatory cells driving racial disparities in lung cancer.
- Utilized single-cell gene signatures to deconvolute the bulk data for improved risk assessment and targeted treatment strategies in high-risk minority populations.

B’s resume says:
- Grew internal single-cell RNA-seq database to 17M+ cells spanning 200+ studies. Improved metadata by adding standardized disease ontologies, cell-level annotations, clearer treatment history, and TCR/BCR clonotype information.
- Created a single-cell RNA-seq reference atlas with dozens of tumor indications with scVI. Used the atlas to automate cell type annotation of new single-cell RNA-seq data with scANVI.

See the difference? A and B both have relevant experience with the tasks that the JD asked for, but B’s experience was just that much more relevant and specific than A’s.

In reviewing my back-and-forth messages with A, one phrase I kept using is “immediately apparent”.

“It is not immediately apparent that you have put together large single-cell atlases from distinct sources and standardized cell type annotations, even though you have worked with scRNA-seq data.”

B's resume, on the other hand, made it immediately apparent that they should get the interview.

Hopefully this helps people see just how much hiring managers for computational biology roles care about exact fit in this job market.

B actually ended up getting the job and started a few weeks ago.

One of the most impactful things a team manager can do is help junior team members grow with a structured development plan.

For a Data Analyst, I believe a great growth plan should cover these key areas:

✅ Business Knowledge

Understanding how data fits into business processes is crucial. I always emphasize CRISP-DM for structuring analytical thinking and encourage learning industry-specific terminology to communicate effectively with stakeholders.

✅ Technical Skills

Mastering the company's current tech stack is essential, along with preparing for upcoming tools. Regardless of the stack, SQL, Python, and visualization skills are crucial.

✅ Research Skills

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a must-have. Analysts should learn to diagnose and resolve data issues, identify patterns, and identify root causes of anomalies in datasets.

✅ Reporting & Documentation

Numbers alone don't tell a story. A great analyst provides context by documenting the purpose, calculation logic, and business relevance of KPIs. Creating user-friendly guides helps stakeholders navigate dashboards without confusion.

✅ Presentation & Visualization

Effective visuals simplify insights. One key rule: one takeaway per visualization. Avoid overcrowding charts with excessive data, less is often more!

✅ Storytelling

Data is only useful when it drives decisions. A compelling analyst transforms data into a narrative, answering the what, why, and how behind the insights.

…more","This is probably one of the biggest mistakes I see from Aspiring Data Analysts

They’ll jump into fancy dashboards, complex queries, and advanced models—yet skip the simplest (but most important) step: understanding the data’s context.

I learned this the hard way.

One of my very first projects involved analyzing customer churn. I spent a week building SQL queries and cool visualizations. But when I presented the findings, the manager pointed out a glaring gap: I didn’t even consider the industry’s unique sales cycle. Half of my recommendations were useless because I never bothered to learn the business side.

The lesson?

Even a perfect query can have wrong insights if you don’t know your domain.

Don’t just analyze rows and columns in a vacuum—ask about the story behind the data, the business process that produces it, and the real-life implications of your numbers.

I see a lot of analysts focusing on what the data looks like, rather than why it looks that way. They collect KPIs without fully grasping how they tie back to actual challenges in marketing, finance, or ops.

Sure, mastering technical skills is crucial. But if you’re not linking your analysis to real-world context, you'll NEVER truly understand the business

So here’s my question for YOU: Which approach has made the biggest difference in your career—knowing every function and formula, or deeply understanding the business behind the data?

I know which changed my results. What about you?

There is nothing wrong with not being too personal and just state that you are hard working, love working with people, really working on complicated projects.

There is also a failure on the other side, why can they not lead the conversation and be a bit more warm instead of feeling like you are on trial.

I like to ask questions and get a better understanding of someone, I just want to see some passion and excitement so I feel they are someone thats human and relatable also I find that asking people questions about stuff they are passionate about just helps move the interview forward instead of being really nervy
